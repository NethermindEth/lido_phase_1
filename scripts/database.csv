Identifying and characterizing Sybils in the Tor network,https://nymity.ch/sybilhunting/pdf/sybilhunting-sec16.pdf,Very relevant,2016,"Being a volunteer-run, distributed anonymity network, Tor is vulnerable to Sybil attacks. Little is known about real-world Sybils in the Tor network, and we lack practical tools and methods to expose Sybil attacks. In this work, we develop sybilhunter, a system for detecting Sybil relays based on their appearance, such as configuration; and behavior, such as uptime sequences. We used sybilhunter’s diverse analysis techniques to analyze
nine years of archived Tor network data, providing us with new insights into the operation of real-world attackers. Our findings include diverse Sybils, ranging from botnets, to academic research, and relays that hijacked Bitcoin transactions. Our work shows that existing Sybil defenses do not apply to Tor, it delivers insights into real world attacks, and provides practical tools to uncoverand characterize Sybils, making the network safer for its users.","Possible tool in larger solution, Sybil resistance insights",5

However, such information is typically confidential, and its verification requires access to off-chain resources.

Therefore, we first outline how smart contract-based verification can be integrated in the Hyperledger Indy credential management routine and, then, provide a technical evaluation based on a proof-of-concept implementation of CL-signature verification on Ethereum.

Blockchain-Based Verifiable Credential Sharing with Selective Disclosure,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9343074,Relevant,2020,"Sharing credentials could raise privacy concerns. For digital credentials to be widely accepted, there is a need for an end-to-end system that provides (i) secure verification of the participant identities and credentials to increase trust, and (ii) a data minimisation mechanism to reduce the risk of oversharing the credential data. This paper proposes CredChain, a blockchain-based Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) platform architecture that allows secure creation, sharing and verification of credentials. Beyond the verification of identities and credentials, a flexible selective disclosure solution is proposed using redactable signatures. The credentials are managed through a decentralised application/wallet which allows users to store their credential data privately under their full control and re-use as necessary. Our evaluation results show that CredChain architecture is feasible, secure and exhibits the level of performance that is within the expected benchmarks of the well-known blockchain platform, Parity Ethereum.","Centralized/permissioned, Not Sybil resistant, Possible tool in larger solution",4

The protocol implements a “credential mechanism”, which is used to transfer personal information about individuals from one organization to another, while allowing individuals to retain substantial control over such transfers.
It is proved that the privacy of individuals is protected in a way that is optimal against cooperation of all organizations, even if the organizations have infinite computational resources. We introduce a “formal credential mechanism”, based on an “ideal RSA cryptosystem”. It allows individuals a chance of successful cheating that is proved to be exponentially small in the amount of computation required.

Verifiable Credentials in the Token Economy,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-95108-5_5,Maybe relevant,2022,"This chapter envisions how verifiable credentials could work in the token economy. Many standards-making bodies, open source working groups, organizations, and individuals are working on self-sovereign identity (SSI) and decentralized verifiable credentials. Commonly suggested principles include identity binding, privacy and security, user control, availability to all, interoperability across platforms, user consent, data minimization, and transparency about data creation, collection, storage, and use. Solutions will likely make use of consensus-driven, international standards in distributed technologies like smart wallets, blockchains, utility tokens, and decentralized identifiers (DIDs). To achieve this vision, the roles of issuers, holders, and verifiers—known as the “trust triangle”—must be incentivized to adopt the solution. We provide examples of two early solutions for verifiable credentials: SmartResume and digital health passes (DHPs). iDatafy’s SmartResume is a job market platform that creates digital resumes based on verifiable credentials and secures these credentials on a blockchain. Digital health passes (DHPs) prove our health to verifiers so we can return to travel, work, school, and play. We assess the degree to which these solutions subscribe to the suggested principles of verifiable credentials and describe how participants are incentivized to join the ecosystem. We found that these first-generation solutions meet some, but not yet all, of the suggested principles for fully decentralized verifiable credentials. The early solutions are “minimal viable products” that will likely improve in the future based on feedback and experimentation. Trusted third parties are still needed for services, and interoperability standards, user-generated identifiers, utility tokens are not yet advanced enough for wide-scale adoptions of SSI and verifiable credentials, but we can more easily see the possibilities.",Critique,2

An Efficient System for Non-transferable Anonymous Credentials with Optional Anonymity Revocation,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-44987-6_7,Maybe relevant,2001,"A credential system is a system in which users can obtain credentials from organizations and demonstrate possession of these credentials. Such a system is anonymous when transactions carried out by the same user cannot be linked. An anonymous credential system is of significant practical relevance because it is the best means of providing privacy for users. In this paper we propose a practical anonymous credential system that is based on the strong RSA assumption and the decisional Diffie-Hellman assumption modulo a safe prime product and is considerably superior to existing ones: (1) We give the first practical solution that allows a user to unlinkably demonstrate possession of a credential as many times as necessary without involving the issuing organization. (2) To prevent misuse of anonymity, our scheme is the first to offer optional anonymity revocation for particular transactions. (3) Our scheme offers separability: all organizations can choose their cryptographic keys independently of each other. Moreover, we suggest more effective means of preventing users from sharing their credentials, by introducing all-or-nothing sharing: a user who allows a friend to use one of her credentials once, gives him the ability to use all of her credentials, i.e., taking over her identity. This is implemented by a new primitive, called circular encryption, which is of independent interest, and can be realized from any semantically secure cryptosystem in the random oracle model.","Anonymity revocation, Anonymous Credentials, Credential sharing prevention",4
Who Watches the Watchmen? A Review of Subjective Approaches for Sybil-Resistance in Proof of Personhood Protocols,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fbloc.2020.590171/full,Relevant,2020,"Most self-sovereign identity systems consist of strictly objective claims, cryptographically signed by trusted third-party attestors. Lacking protocols in place to account for subjectivity, these systems do not form new sources of legitimacy that can address the central question concerning identity authentication: “Who verifies the verifier?” The legitimacy of claims is instead derived from traditional centralized institutions such as national ID issuers and KYC providers. This architecture has been employed, in part, to safeguard protocols from a vulnerability previously thought to be impossible to address in peer-to-peer identity systems: the Sybil attack, which refers to the abuse of a digital network by creating many illegitimate virtual personas. Inspired by the progress in cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, there has recently been a surge in networked protocols that make use of subjective inputs such as voting, vouching, and interpreting to arrive at a decentralized and Sybil-resistant consensus for identity. In doing so, these projects illustrate that the best technologies do not abstract away subjectivity but instead embrace it as a necessity and strength. In this review, we will outline the approaches of these new and natively digital sources of authentication—their attributes, methodologies, strengths, and weaknesses—and sketch out possible directions for future developments.","Good reference source, Sybil resistance insights",5

Existing and proposed approaches also presume the spontaneous availability of a credential-issuance ecosystem, creating a bootstrapping problem. They also omit essential functionality, like resistance to Sybil attacks and the ability to detect misbehaving or sanctioned users while preserving user privacy. CanDID addresses these challenges by issuing credentials
in a user-friendly way that draws securely and privately on data from existing, unmodified web service providers. Such legacy compatibility similarly enables CanDID users to leverage their existing online accounts for recovery of lost keys. Using a decentralized committee of nodes, CanDID provides strong confidentiality for user’s keys, real-world identities, and data, yet prevents users from spawning multiple identities and allows identification (and blacklisting) of sanctioned users. We present the CanDID architecture and its technical innovations and report on experiments demonstrating its practical performance.","Legacy compatible, Management of credentials, Sybil resistance insights",5

zk-creds: Flexible Anonymous Credentials from zkSNARKs and Existing Identity Infrastructure,https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/878.pdf,Relevant,2022,"Frequently, users on the web need to show that they are, for example, not a robot, old enough to access an age restricted video, or eligible to download an ebook from their local public library without being tracked. Anonymous credentials were developed to address these concerns. However, existing schemes do not handle the realities of deployment or the complexities of real world identity. Instead, they make (often incorrect) assumptions, e.g., that the local department of motor vehicles will issue sophisticated cryptographic tokens to show users are over 18. In reality, there are multiple trust sources for a given identity attribute, their credentials have distinctively different formats, and many, if not all, issuers are unwilling to adopt new protocols. We present and build zk-creds, a protocol that uses general-purpose zero-knowledge proofs to 1) remove the need for credential issuers to hold signing keys: credentials can be issued via a transparency log, Byzantine system, or even a blockchain; 2) convert existing identity documents into anonymous credentials without modifying documents or coordinating with their issuing authority; 3) allow for flexible, composable, and complex identity statements over multiple credentials.

Digital signature schemes are a fundamental cryptographic primitive, of use both in its own right, and as a building block in cryptographic protocol design. In this paper, we propose a practical and provably secure signature scheme and show protocols (1) for issuing a signature on a committed value (so the signer has no information about the signed value), and (2) for proving knowledge of a signature on a committed value. This signature scheme and corresponding protocols are a building block for the design of anonymity-enhancing cryptographic systems, such as electronic cash, group signatures, and anonymous credential systems.

Decentralized Anonymous Credentials,https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/clg/files/NDSS14.pdf,Very relevant,2014,"Anonymous credentials provide a powerful tool for making assertions about identity while maintaining privacy. However, a limitation of today’s anonymous credential systems is the need for a trusted credential issuer — which is both a single point of failure and a target for compromise. Furthermore, the need for such a trusted issuer can make it challenging to deploy credential systems in practice, particularly in the ad hoc network setting (e.g., anonymous peer-to-peer networks) where no single party can be trusted with this responsibility. In this work we propose a novel anonymous credential scheme that eliminates the need for a trusted credential issuer. Our approach builds on recent results in the area of electronic cash that, given a public append-only ledger, do not need a trusted credential issuer. Furthermore, given a distributed public ledger, as in, e.g., Bitcoin, our system requires no credential issuer at all and hence is decentralized. Using such a public ledger and standard cryptographic primitives, we propose and provide a proof of security for a basic anonymous credential system that allows users to make flexible identity assertions with strong privacy guarantees without relying on trusted parties. Finally, we discuss a number of practical applications for our techniques, including resource management in ad hoc networks and prevention of Sybil attacks.

Secretation: Toward a Decentralised Identity and Verifiable Credentials Based Scalable and Decentralised Secret Management Solution,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9461144,Not relevant,2021,"``Secrets such as passwords, encryption keys, and certificates are used to assist in protecting access to resources such as computing devices, customer data and other information. Unauthorised access to resources can cause significant disruption and/or disastrous consequences. Given the importance of protecting these secrets to the security and privacy of many software systems, many solutions have been proposed. These solutions take two main directions: either securely store the secret and implement an access control mechanism, or divide the secret into a set of shares and distribute them in different machines (such as the Shamir’s secret sharing approach or multi-party computation MPC). However, apart from the MPC approach, they all share the same limitation: once the consumer receives the secret, it can be leaked and be used by any malicious actor. We believe that the secret management should not be centralised and that the secret should never be sent to the receiver. Therefore, in this paper we propose, Secretation, a new approach for managing the secrets in a decentralised way by leveraging decentralised identity concepts such as verifiable credential technologies, password-authenticated key exchange protocols and multi-party computation. The result is a more scalable and secure solution that significantly reduces the risk of leaking the secrets.''

Their key envisioned uses (e.g. financial instruments) require them to consume data from outside the blockchain (e.g. stock quotes). Trustworthy data feeds that support a broad range of data requests will thus be critical to smart contract ecosystems.
We present an authenticated data feed system called Town Crier (TC). TC acts as a bridge between smart contracts and existing web sites, which are already commonly trusted for non-blockchain applications. It combines a blockchain front end with a trusted hardware back end to scrape HTTPS-enabled websites and serve source-authenticated data to relying smart contracts. 
TC also supports confidentiality. It enables private data requests with encrypted parameters. Additionally, in a generalization that executes smart-contract logic within TC, the system permits secure use of user credentials to scrape access-controlled online data sources. 
We describe TC’s design principles and architecture and report on an implementation that uses Intel’s recently introduced Software Guard Extensions (SGX) to furnish data to the Ethereum smart contract system. We formally model TC and define and prove its basic security properties in the Universal Composability (UC) framework.

Because each individual provides most organizations essentially the same
Uniquely identifjlng information, such as social security number, or name, age and place of birth, the records held by one organization on an individual are readily matched or linked with those held by other organizations. Thus, organizations are capable of exchanging information about
individuals whenever and to whatever extent they choose. Clearly some such transfers of information are quite useful and beneficial to society. The problems stem from the inability of anyone, particularly the individuals whose data is involved, to control or even effdvely monitor such transfers. These problems were not present in completely paper based systems, where the transfer of information about an individual was only through credential documents issued to the individual by one organization and shown by the individual to other organizations.

Cryptographic protocols that give individuals the ability to effectively control and monitor transfers in completely computer based systems, are presented. The essential idea is that an individual will be known to each organization by different pseudonym, and that the individual will retain the exclusive ability to link the pseudonyms and transform digitally singed statements or credentials made about one pseudonym into credentials about the individual's other pseudonyms.
Thus the individual regains control over inter-organizational transfers.","Anonymous Credentials, Classic reference",5
A Survey on Non-transferable Anonymous Credentials,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-03315-5_8,Maybe relevant,2022,"There are at least two principal approaches to prevent users from sharing their anonymous credentials: adding valuable secrets into the system the user does not want to share or embedding biometric access control. This paper seeks to identify possible fields of application and to compare both approaches with respect to the credentials’ non-transferability. 

The paper shows that both approaches do not ensure the non-transferability of anonymous credentials, but may be applicable in some fields. On the one hand, it might be hard to find valuable secrets to really prevent the sharing of credentials, in particular with close family members. On the other hand, biometric sensors embedded in a smartcard can be circumvented with some effort, especially if access control is unattended. Although the combination of both approaches may prevent more users from sharing their credentials, it suffers from restrictions of both approaches and from the effort needed to put it in place.

However, assuming that anonymous credentials will probably not be used in high-security environments, both approaches might be sufficient to prevent sharing in some applications. If the users already possess personal digital assistants, embedded valuable secrets are a quite cheap solution, even though they raise the system’s value. If access control is attended, biometric sensors are reasonably safe and limit the possibility of unintentionally sharing the credentials for free.","Anonymous Credentials, Good reference source",2
A Truth-Inducing Sybil Resistant Decentralized Blockchain Oracle,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9223272,Very relevant,2020,"Many blockchain applications use decentralized oracles to trustlessly retrieve external information as those platforms are agnostic to real-world information. Some existing decentralized oracle protocols make use of majority-voting schemes to determine the outcomes and/or rewards to participants. In these cases, the awards (or penalties) grow linearly to the participant stakes, therefore voters are indifferent between voting through a single or multiple identities. Furthermore, the voters receive a reward only when they agree with the majority outcome, a tactic that may lead to herd behavior. This paper proposes an oracle protocol based on peer prediction mechanisms with non-linear staking rules. In the proposed approach, instead of being rewarded when agreeing with a majority outcome, a voter receives awards when their report achieves a relatively high score based on a peer prediction scoring scheme. The scoring scheme is designed to be incentive compatible so that the maximized expected score is achieved only with honest reporting. A non-linear stake scaling rule is proposed to discourage Sybil attacks. This paper also provides a theoretical analysis and guidelines for implementation as reference.","Collusion prevention, Sybil resistance insights",2

What is more, p-ABCs can help to solve privacy issues that have been identified in applications of VCs to use cases like vaccination passports. However, there has not been much work focusing on the collaboration between p-ABCs and VCs. We address this topic by establishing initial steps for extra standardization of elements that will help with the integration of p-ABCs into the standard.

NSSIA: A New Self-Sovereign Identity Scheme with Accountability,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/scn/2022/1607996/,Maybe relevant,2022,"Self-sovereign identity (SSI) is a new distributed method for identity management, commonly used to address the problem that users are lack of control over their identities. However, the excessive pursuit of self-sovereignty in the most existing SSI schemes hinders sanctions against attackers. To deal with the malicious behavior, a few SSI schemes introduce accountability mechanisms, but they sacrifice users’ privacy. In addition, the digital identities (static strings or updatable chains) in the existing SSI schemes are as inputs to a third-party executable program (mobile app, smart contract, etc.) to achieve identity reading, storing and proving, and users’ self-sovereignty are weakened. To solve the above problems, we present a new self-sovereign identity scheme to strike a balance between privacy and accountability and get rid of the dependence on the third-party program. In our scheme, one and only individual-specific executable code is generated as a digital avatar-i for each human to interact with others in cyberspace without a third-party program, in which the embedding of biometrics enhances uniqueness and user control over their identity. In addition, a joint accountability mechanism, which is based on the shamir (t, n) threshold algorithm and a consortium blockchain, is designed to restrict the power of each regulatory authority and protect users’ privacy. Finally, we analyze the security, SSI properties and conduct detailed experiments in terms of the cost of computation, storage, and blockchain gas. The analysis results indicate that our scheme resists the known attacks and fulfills all the six SSI properties. Compared with the state-of-the-art schemes, the extensive experiment results show that the cost is larger in server storage, blockchain storage, and blockchain gas, but is still low enough for practical situations.","Decentralized identity, Implementations, Management of credentials, Sybil resistance insights, Verifiable Credentials",3

It realizes efficient access control on permissionless blockchains while achieving both privacy and accountability. In all prior solutions, users either pay exorbitant fees or lose privacy since authorities granting access can map users to their wallets. Hence, ZEBRA is the first to enable DeFi platforms to remain compliant with imminent regulations without compromising user privacy.
We evaluate ZEBRA and show that it reduces the gas cost incurred on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) by 11.8x when compared to Coconut [NDSS 2019], the state-of-the-art AC scheme for blockchains. This translates to a reduction in transaction fees from 94 USD to 8 USD on Ethereum in August 2022. However, 8 USD is still high for most applications, and ZEBRA further drives down credential verification costs through batched verification. For a batch of 512 layer-1 and layer-2 wallets, the gas cost is reduced by 35x and 641x on EVM, and the transaction fee is reduced to just 0.23 USD and 0.0126 USD on Ethereum, respectively.

Although the debate about the medical and ethical problems of immunity passports has been widespread, there has been less inspection of the technical foundations of immunity passport schemes. These schemes are envisaged to be used for sharing COVID-19 test and vaccination results in general. The most prominent immunity passport schemes have involved a stack of little-known standards, such as Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs) from the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Our analysis shows that this group of technical identity standards are based on under-specified and often non-standardized documents that have substantial security and privacy issues, due in part to the questionable use of blockchain technology. One concrete proposal for immunity passports is even susceptible to dictionary attacks. The use of cryptography theater' in efforts like immunity passports, where cryptography is used to allay the privacy concerns of users, should be discouraged in standardization. Deployment of these W3C standards for `self-sovereign identity' in use-cases like immunity passports could just as well lead to a dangerous form identity totalitarianism.","Critique, Implementations, Standardization efforts",5
Dynamic Accumulators and Application to Efficient Revocation of Anonymous Credentials,https://cs.brown.edu/people/alysyans/papers/camlys02.pdf,Maybe relevant,2002,"An accumulator scheme, as introduced by Benaloh and de Mare [BdM94] and further studied by Baric and Pfitzmann [BP97], is an algorithm that allows one to hash a large set of inputs into one short value, called the accumulator, such that there is a (short) witness that a given input was incorporated into the accumulator. At the same time, it is infeasible to find a witness for a value that was not accumulated. We put forward the notion of a dynamic accumulator, which is an accumulator that allows one to dynamically add and delete inputs, such that the cost of an add or delete is independent of the number of accumulated values. We achieve this under the strong RSA assumption. For this construction, we also show an efficient zero-knowledge protocol for proving that a committed value is in the accumulator. Dynamic accumulators enable efficient membership revocation in the anonymous setting. Our construction is especially suitable for membership revocation in group signature and identity escrow schemes, such as the one due to Ateniese et al. [ACJT00], and efficient revocation of credentials in anonymous credential systems, such as the one due to Camenisch and Lysyanskaya [CL01a]. Applying our method to these schemes enables membership revocation and yet does not significantly increase the complexity of any of the operations. In particular, the cost of a membership verification or credential showing increases by only a small constant factor, less than 2. All previously known methods (such as the ones due to Bresson and Stern [BS01] and Ateniese and Tsudik [AT01]) incur an increase in these costs that is linear in the number of members.","Anonymous Credentials, Classic reference",4

A Verifiable Credentials System with Privacy-Preserving Based on Blockchain,https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation.aspx?paperid=115526,Maybe relevant,2022,"Decentralized identity authentication is generally based on blockchain, with the protection of user privacy as the core appeal. But traditional decentralized credential system requires users to show all the information of the entire credential to the verifier, resulting in unnecessary overexposure of personal information. From the perspective of user privacy, this paper proposed a verifiable credential scheme with selective disclosure based on BLS (Bohen- Lynn-Shacham) aggregate signature. Instead of signing the credentials, we sign the claims in the credentials. When the user needs to present the credential to verifier, the user can select a part of but not all claims to be presented. To reduce the number of signatures of claims after selective disclosure, BLS aggregate signature is achieved to aggregate signatures of claims into one signature. In addition, our scheme also supports the aggregation of credentials from different users. As a result, verifier only needs to verify one signature in the credential to achieve the purpose of batch verification of credentials. We analyze the security of our aggregate signature scheme, which can effectively resist aggregate signature forgery attack and credential theft attack. The simulation results show that our selective disclosure scheme based on BLS aggregate signature is acceptable in terms of verification efficiency, and can reduce the storage cost and communication overhead. As a result, our scheme is suitable for blockchain, which is strict on bandwidth and storage overhead.","Anonymous Credentials, Verifiable Credentials",1

This motivates the need for a seamless and standardized internet-wide non-repudiation mechanism, allowing users to share data from news sources, social websites or financial data feeds in a provably secure manner. Additionally, blockchain oracles that enable data-rich smart contracts typically rely on a trusted third party (e.g., TLSNotary or Intel SGX). A decentralized method to transfer webbased content into a permissionless blockchain without additional trusted third party would allow for smart contract applications to flourish. In this work, we present TLS-N, the first TLS extension that provides secure non-repudiation and solves both of the mentioned challenges.

TLS-N is compatible with TLS 1.3 and adds a minor overhead to a typical TLS session. When a proof is generated, parts of the TLS session (e.g., passwords, cookies) can be hidden for privacy reasons, while the remaining content can be verified.","Legacy compatible, Linkage of Web2 Ids, Web2 credentials, Web2 to Web3 data transfer",3
