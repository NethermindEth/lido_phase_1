"Zero-Knowledge Proof-of-Identity: Sybil-Resistant, Anonymous Authentication on Permissionless Blockchains and Incentive Compatible, Strictly Dominant Cryptocurrencies",https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.09093.pdf,Not relevant,2020,"Zero-Knowledge Proof-of-Identity from trusted public certificates (e.g.,
national identity cards and/or ePassports; eSIM) is introduced here to
permissionless blockchains in order to remove the inefficiencies of Sybil-
resistant mechanisms such as Proof-of-Work (i.e., high energy and en-
vironmental costs) and Proof-of-Stake (i.e., capital hoarding and lower
transaction volume). The proposed solution effectively limits the number
of mining nodes a single individual would be able to run while keeping
membership open to everyone, circumventing the impossibility of full de-
centralization and the blockchain scalability trilemma when instantiated
on a blockchain with a consensus protocol based on the cryptographic
random selection of nodes. Resistance to collusion is also considered.
Solving one of the most pressing problems in blockchains, a zk-PoI
cryptocurrency is proved to have the following advantageous properties:
- an incentive-compatible protocol for the issuing of cryptocurrency
rewards based on a unique Nash equilibrium
- strict domination of mining over all other PoW/PoS cryptocurrencies,
thus the zk-PoI cryptocurrency becoming the preferred choice by miners
is proved to be a Nash equilibrium and the Evolutionarily Stable Strategy
- PoW/PoS cryptocurrencies are condemned to pay the Price of Crypto-
Anarchy, redeemed by the optimal efficiency of zk-PoI as it implements
the social optimum
- the circulation of a zk-PoI cryptocurrency Pareto dominates other
PoW/PoS cryptocurrencies
- the network effects arising from the social networks inherent to na-
tional identity cards and ePassports dominate PoW/PoS cryptocurrencies
- the lower costs of its infrastructure imply the existence of a unique
equilibrium where it dominates other forms of payment",,,
Access with Fast Batch Verifiable Anonymous Credentials,https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-540-88625-9,Not relevant,2008,"An anonymous credential-based access control system allows the user to prove possession of credentials to a resource guard that enforce access policies on one or more resources, whereby interactions involving the same user are unlinkable by the resource guard. This paper proposes three fast batch verifiable anonymous credential schemes. With all three schemes, the user can arbitrarily choose a portion of his access rights to prove possession of credentials while the number of expensive cryptographic computations spent is independent of the number of accessx rights being chosen. Moreover, the third anonymous credential scheme is not only fast batch verifiable but also fast fine-grained revocable, which means that to verify whether an arbitrarily chosen subset of credentials is revoked entails constant computation cost.",VC,"Anonymous Credentials, Not Sybil resistant",1
Anonymous credentials light,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2508859.2516687,Maybe relevant,2013,"We define and propose an efficient and provably secure construction of blind signatures with attributes. Prior notions of blind signatures did not yield themselves to the construction of anonymous credential systems, not even if we drop the unlinkability requirement of anonymous credentials. Our new notion in contrast is a convenient building block for anonymous credential systems. The construction we propose is efficient: it requires just a few exponentiations in a prime-order group in which the decisional Diffie-Hellman problem is hard. Thus, for the first time, we give a provably secure construction of anonymous credentials that can work in the elliptic group setting without bilinear pairings and is based on the DDH assumption. In contrast, prior provably secure constructions were based on the RSA group or on groups with pairings, which made them prohibitively inefficient for mobile devices, RFIDs and smartcards. The only prior efficient construction that could work in such elliptic curve groups, due to Brands, does not have a proof of security.",Anonymous Credentials,"Anonymous Credentials, Signature scheme",1

Revocation is critical to the security of such systems. We construct a short group signature scheme that supports Verifier-Local Revocation (VLR). In this model, revocation messages are only sent to signature verifiers (as opposed to both signers and verifiers). Consequently there is no need to contact individual signers when some user is revoked. This model is appealing for systems providing attestation capabilities. Our signatures are as short as standard RSA signatures with comparable security. Security of our group signature (in the random oracle model) is based on the Strong Diffie-Hellman assumption and the Decision Linear assumption in bilinear groups.

These acclaimed proofs, however, are either trivial to falsify or require trust in centralized entities (e.g., search engine caches). This motivates the need for a seamless and standardized internet-wide non-repudiation mechanism, allowing users to share data from news sources, social websites or financial data feeds in a provably secure manner. Additionally, blockchain oracles that enable data-rich smart contracts typically rely on a trusted third party (e.g., TLSNotary or Intel SGX). A decentralized method to transfer webbased content into a permissionless blockchain without additional trusted third party would allow for smart contract applications to flourish. In this work, we present TLS-N, the first TLS extension that provides secure non-repudiation and solves both of the mentioned challenges. TLS-N generates non-interactive proofs about the content of a TLS session that can be efficiently verified by third parties and blockchain based smart contracts. As such, TLS-N increases the accountability for content provided on the web and enables a practical and decentralized blockchain oracle for web content. TLS-N is compatible with TLS 1.3 and adds a minor overhead to a typical TLS session.

Vision: A Critique of Immunity Passports and W3C Decentralized Identifiers,https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.00136,Relevant,2020,"Due to the widespread COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a push for immunity passports' and even technical proposals. Although the debate about the medical and ethical problems of immunity passports has been widespread, there has been less inspection of the technical foundations of immunity passport schemes. These schemes are envisaged to be used for sharing COVID-19 test and vaccination results in general. The most prominent immunity passport schemes have involved a stack of little-known standards, such as Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs) from the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Our analysis shows that this group of technical identity standards are based on under-specified and often non-standardized documents that have substantial security and privacy issues, due in part to the questionable use of blockchain technology. One concrete proposal for immunity passports is even susceptible to dictionary attacks. The use of cryptography theater' in efforts like immunity passports, where cryptography is used to allay the privacy concerns of users, should be discouraged in standardization. Deployment of these W3C standards for `self-sovereign identity' in use-cases like immunity passports could just as well lead to a dangerous form identity totalitarianism.","DI, VC","Critique, Implementations, Standardization efforts",4
zk-creds: Flexible Anonymous Credentials from zkSNARKs and Existing Identity Infrastructure,https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/878.pdf,Relevant,2022,"Frequently, users on the web need to show that they are, for example, not a robot, old enough to access an age restricted video, or eligible to download an ebook from their local public library without being tracked. Anonymous credentials were developed to address these concerns. However, existing schemes do not handle the realities of deployment or the complexities of real world identity. Instead, they make (often incorrect) assumptions, e.g., that the local department of motor vehicles will issue sophisticated cryptographic tokens to show users are over 18. In reality, there are multiple trust sources for a given identity attribute, their credentials have distinctively different formats, and many, if not all, issuers are unwilling to adopt new protocols. We present and build zk-creds, a protocol that uses general-purpose zero-knowledge proofs to 1) remove the need for credential issuers to hold signing keys: credentials can be issued via a transparency log, Byzantine system, or even a blockchain; 2) convert existing identity documents into anonymous credentials without modifying documents or coordinating with their issuing authority; 3) allow for flexible, composable, and complex identity statements over multiple credentials.

Contrary to most existing voting approaches, we use the input of a set of motivated experts of varying levels of expertise. In particular, we develop an approval voting inspired selection mechanism through which the experts approve or disapprove the different updates according to their perception of the quality of each alternative. Given their opinions, and weighted by their expertise level, a single update is then implemented and evaluated, and the experts receive rewards based on their choices. We show that this mechanism always has approximate pure Nash equilibria and that these achieve a constant factor approximation with respect to the quality benchmark of the optimal alternative. Finally, we study the repeated version of the problem, where the weights of the experts are adjusted after each update, according to their performance. Under mild assumptions about the weights, the extension of our mechanism still has approximate pure Nash equilibria in this setting.''

Secretation: Toward a Decentralised Identity and Verifiable Credentials Based Scalable and Decentralised Secret Management Solution,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9461144,Not relevant,2021,"``Secrets such as passwords, encryption keys, and certificates are used to assist in protecting access to resources such as computing devices, customer data and other information. Unauthorised access to resources can cause significant disruption and/or disastrous consequences. Given the importance of protecting these secrets to the security and privacy of many software systems, many solutions have been proposed. These solutions take two main directions: either securely store the secret and implement an access control mechanism, or divide the secret into a set of shares and distribute them in different machines (such as the Shamir’s secret sharing approach or multi-party computation MPC). However, apart from the MPC approach, they all share the same limitation: once the consumer receives the secret, it can be leaked and be used by any malicious actor. We believe that the secret management should not be centralised and that the secret should never be sent to the receiver. Therefore, in this paper we propose, Secretation, a new approach for managing the secrets in a decentralised way by leveraging decentralised identity concepts such as verifiable credential technologies, password-authenticated key exchange protocols and multi-party computation. The result is a more scalable and secure solution that significantly reduces the risk of leaking the secrets.''

A Survey on Non-transferable Anonymous Credentials,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-03315-5_8,Not relevant,2022,"There are at least two principal approaches to prevent users from sharing their anonymous credentials: adding valuable secrets into the system the user does not want to share or embedding biometric access control. This paper seeks to identify possible fields of application and to compare both approaches with respect to the credentials’ non-transferability.
The paper shows that both approaches do not ensure the non- transferability of anonymous credentials, but may be applicable in some fields. On the one hand, it might be hard to find valuable secrets to really prevent the sharing of credentials, in particular with close family members. On the other hand, biometric sensors embedded in a smartcard can be circumvented with some effort, especially if access control is unattended. Although the combination of both approaches may prevent more users from sharing their credentials, it suffers from restrictions of both approaches and from the effort needed to put it in place.
However, assuming that anonymous credentials will probably not be used in high-security environments, both approaches might be sufficient to prevent sharing in some applications. If the users already possess personal digital assistants, embedded valuable secrets are a quite cheap solution, even though they raise the system’s value. If access control is attended, biometric sensors are reasonably safe and limit the possibility of unintentionally sharing the credentials for free.",Anonymous Credentials,,0

An anonymous credential system is of significant practical relevance because it is the best means of providing privacy for users. In this paper we propose a practical anonymous credential system that is based on the strong RSA assumption and the decisional Diffie-Hellman assumption modulo a safe prime product and is considerably superior to existing ones: (1) We give the first practical solution that allows a user to unlinkably demonstrate possession of a credential as many times as necessary without involving the issuing organization. (2) To prevent misuse of anonymity, our scheme is the first to offer optional anonymity revocation for particular transactions. (3) Our scheme offers separability: all organizations can choose their cryptographic keys independently of each other.

Dynamic Accumulators and Application to Efficient Revocation of Anonymous Credentials,https://cs.brown.edu/people/alysyans/papers/camlys02.pdf,Not relevant,2002,"An accumulator scheme, as introduced by Benaloh and de Mare [BdM94] and further studied by Baric and Pfitzmann [BP97], is an algorithm that allows one to hash a large set of inputs into one short value, called the accumulator, such that there is a (short) witness that a given input was incorporated into the accumulator. At the same time, it is infeasible to find a witness for a value that was not accumulated. We put forward the notion of a dynamic accumulator, which is an accumulator that allows one to dynamically add and delete inputs, such that the cost of an add or delete is independent of the number of accumulated values. We achieve this under the strong RSA assumption. For this construction, we also show an efficient zero-knowledge protocol for proving that a committed value is in the accumulator. Dynamic accumulators enable efficient membership revocation in the anonymous setting. Our construction is especially suitable for membership revocation in group signature and identity escrow schemes, such as the one due to Ateniese et al. [ACJT00], and efficient revocation of credentials in anonymous credential systems, such as the one due to Camenisch and Lysyanskaya [CL01a]. Applying our method to these schemes enables membership revocation and yet does not significantly increase the complexity of any of the operations. In particular, the cost of a membership verification or credential

NSSIA: A New Self-Sovereign Identity Scheme with Accountability,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/scn/2022/1607996/,,2022,"Self-sovereign identity (SSI) is a new distributed method for identity management, commonly used to address the problem that users are lack of control over their identities. However, the excessive pursuit of self-sovereignty in the most existing SSI schemes hinders sanctions against attackers. To deal with the malicious behavior, a few SSI schemes introduce accountability mechanisms, but they sacrifice users’ privacy. In addition, the digital identities (static strings or updatable chains) in the existing SSI schemes are as inputs to a third-party executable program (mobile app, smart contract, etc.) to achieve identity reading, storing and proving, and users’ self-sovereignty are weakened. To solve the above problems, we present a new self-sovereign identity scheme to strike a balance between privacy and accountability and get rid of the dependence on the third-party program. In our scheme, one and only individual-specific executable code is generated as a digital avatar-i for each human to interact with others in cyberspace without a third-party program, in which the embedding of biometrics enhances uniqueness and user control over their identity. In addition, a joint accountability mechanism, which is based on the shamir (t, n) threshold algorithm and a consortium blockchain, is designed to restrict the power of each regulatory authority and protect users’ privacy. Finally, we analyze the security, SSI properties and conduct detailed experiments in terms of the cost of computation, storage, and blockchain gas. The analysis results indicate that our scheme resists the known attacks and fulfills all the six SSI properties. Compared with the state-of-the-art schemes, the extensive experiment results show that the cost is larger in server storage, blockchain storage, and blockchain gas, but is still low enough for practical situations.",,,

In this work we propose a novel anonymous credential scheme that eliminates the need for a trusted credential issuer.

Furthermore, given a distributed public ledger, as in, e.g., Bitcoin, our system requires no credential issuer at all and hence is decentralized. Using such a public ledger and standard cryptographic primitives, we propose and provide a proof of security for a basic anonymous credential system that allows users to make flexible identity assertions with strong privacy guarantees without relying on trusted parties.

Recognizing these limitations, we propose SYBILFUSE, a defense-in-depth framework for Sybil detection when the oversimplified assumptions are relaxed.

A Truth-Inducing Sybil Resistant Decentralized Blockchain Oracle,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9223272,Very relevant,2020,"Many blockchain applications use decentralized oracles to trustlessly retrieve external information as those platforms are agnostic to real-world information.

Furthermore, the voters receive a reward only when they agree with the majority outcome, a tactic that may lead to herd behavior. This paper proposes an oracle protocol based on peer prediction mechanisms with non-linear staking rules. In the proposed approach, instead of being rewarded when agreeing with a majority outcome, a voter receives awards when their report achieves a relatively high score based on a peer prediction scoring scheme. The scoring scheme is designed to be incentive compatible so that the maximized expected score is achieved only with honest reporting.

Privacy-preserving Identity Management System,https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1459.pdf,Maybe relevant,2021,"Abstract. Recently, a self-sovereign identity model has been researched actively as an alternative to the existing identity models such as a centralized identity model, federated identity model, and user-centric model.  The self-sovereign identity model allows a user to have complete control of his identity. Meanwhile, the core component of the self-sovereign identity model is data minimization. The data minimization signifies that the extent of the exposure of user private identity should be minimized. As a solution to data minimization, zero-knowledge proofs can be grafted to the self-sovereign identity model. Specifically, zero-knowledge Succinct Non-interactive ARgument of Knowledges(zk-SNARKs) enables proving the truth of the statement on an arbitrary relation. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving self-sovereign identity model based on zkSNARKs to allow any type of data minimization beyond the selective disclosure and range proof. The security of proposed model is formally proven under the security of the zero-knowledge proof and the unforgeability of the signature in the random oracle model. Furthermore, we optimize the proving time by checking the correctness of the commitment outside of the proof relation for practical use. The resulting scheme improves proving time for hash computation (to verify a commitment input) from 0.5 s to about 0.1 ms on a 32-bit input.",Anonymous Credentials,,

A Verifiable Credentials System with Privacy-Preserving Based on Blockchain,https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation.aspx?paperid=115526,Maybe relevant,2022,"Decentralized identity authentication is generally based on blockchain, with the protection of user privacy as the core appeal. But traditional decentralized credential system requires users to show all the information of the entire credential to the verifier, resulting in unnecessary overexposure of personal information. From the perspective of user privacy, this paper proposed a verifiable credential scheme with selective disclosure based on BLS (Bohen- Lynn-Shacham) aggregate signature. Instead of signing the credentials, we sign the claims in the credentials. When the user needs to present the credential to verifier, the user can select a part of but not all claims to be presented. To reduce the number of signatures of claims after selective disclosure, BLS aggregate signature is achieved to aggregate signatures of claims into one signature. In addition, our scheme also supports the aggregation of credentials from different users. As a result, verifier only needs to verify one signature in the credential to achieve the purpose of batch verification of credentials. We analyze the security of our aggregate signature scheme, which can effectively resist aggregate signature forgery attack and credential theft attack. The simulation results show that our selective disclosure scheme based on BLS aggregate signature is acceptable in terms of verification efficiency, and can reduce the storage cost and communication overhead. As a result, our scheme is suitable for blockchain, which is strict on bandwidth and storage overhead.","Anonymous Credentials, VC","Anonymous Credentials, Verifiable Credentials",0

Self-Sovereign Identity Solutions: The Necessity of Blockchain Technology.,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.12816.pdf,Not relevant,2019,"With the advancement of technology and subsequently the age of digital information, online trustworthy identification has become increasingly more important. With respect to the various data breaches and privacy regulations, the current identity solutions are not fully optimized. In this paper, we will
take a look at several Self-Sovereign Identity solutions which are already available. Some of them are built upon blockchain technology as this already provides decentralized persistent data and consensus. We will explore the emerging landscape of SelfSovereign Identity solutions and dissect their implementations under multiple aspect criteria to determine the necessity of
blockchain technology in this field. We conclude that blockchain technology is not explicitly required for a Self-Sovereign Identity solution but it is a good foundation to build up on, due to various technical advantages that the blockchain has to offer.",,Good reference source,

Verifiable Credentials in the Token Economy,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-95108-5_5,Not relevant,2022,"This chapter envisions how verifiable credentials could work in the token economy. Many standards-making bodies, open source working groups, organizations, and individuals are working on self-sovereign identity (SSI) and decentralized verifiable credentials. Commonly suggested principles include identity binding, privacy and security, user control, availability to all, interoperability across platforms, user consent, data minimization, and transparency about data creation, collection, storage, and use. Solutions will likely make use of consensus-driven, international standards in distributed technologies like smart wallets, blockchains, utility tokens, and decentralized identifiers (DIDs). To achieve this vision, the roles of issuers, holders, and verifiers—known as the “trust triangle”—must be incentivized to adopt the solution. We provide examples of two early solutions for verifiable credentials: SmartResume and digital health passes (DHPs). iDatafy’s SmartResume is a job market platform that creates digital resumes based on verifiable credentials and secures these credentials on a blockchain. Digital health passes (DHPs) prove our health to verifiers so we can return to travel, work, school, and play. We assess the degree to which these solutions subscribe to the suggested principles of verifiable credentials and describe how participants are incentivized to join the ecosystem. We found that these first-generation solutions meet some, but not yet all, of the suggested principles for fully decentralized verifiable credentials. The early solutions are “minimal viable products” that will likely improve in the future based on feedback and experimentation. Trusted third parties are still needed for services, and interoperability standards, user-generated identifiers, utility tokens are not yet advanced enough for wide-scale adoptions of SSI and verifiable credentials, but we can more easily see the possibilities.",VC,Critique,1
Who Watches the Watchmen? A Review of Subjective Approaches for Sybil-Resistance in Proof of Personhood Protocols,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fbloc.2020.590171/full,Relevant,2020,"Most self-sovereign identity systems consist of strictly objective claims, cryptographically signed by trusted third-party attestors. Lacking protocols in place to account for subjectivity, these systems do not form new sources of legitimacy that can address the central question concerning identity authentication: “Who verifies the verifier?” The legitimacy of claims is instead derived from traditional centralized institutions such as national ID issuers and KYC providers. This architecture has been employed, in part, to safeguard protocols from a vulnerability previously thought to be impossible to address in peer-to-peer identity systems: the Sybil attack, which refers to the abuse of a digital network by creating many illegitimate virtual personas. Inspired by the progress in cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, there has recently been a surge in networked protocols that make use of subjective inputs such as voting, vouching, and interpreting to arrive at a decentralized and Sybil-resistant consensus for identity. In doing so, these projects illustrate that the best technologies do not abstract away subjectivity but instead embrace it as a necessity and strength. In this review, we will outline the approaches of these new and natively digital sources of authentication—their attributes, methodologies, strengths, and weaknesses—and sketch out possible directions for future developments.",,"Good reference source, Worthwile Sybil resistance insights",
A Decentralized Public Key Infrastructure with Identity Retention,https://eprint.iacr.org/2014/803,Maybe relevant,2014,"Public key infrastructures (PKIs) enable users to look up and verify one another's public keys based on identities.
Current approaches to PKIs are vulnerable because they do not offer sufficiently strong guarantees of \emph{identity retention}; that is, they do not effectively prevent one user from registering a public key under another's already-registered identity.
In this paper, we leverage the consistency guarantees provided by cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Namecoin to build a PKI that ensures identity retention.

duplication, has serious security lacunae and is cumbersome
to the users. The Self-sovereign Identity (SSI) concept, which

authentication and verification of digital identity is essential

Blockchain technology can help to realize a self-sovereign identity that puts the user in control of her information, by enabling a decentralized way to handle public key infrastructure.

What is more, p-ABCs can help to solve privacy issues that have been identified in applications of VCs to use cases like vaccination passports. However, there has not been much work focusing on the collaboration between p-ABCs and VCs. We address this topic by establishing initial steps for extra standardization of elements that will help with the integration of p-ABCs into the standard. Namely, we propose a data model for predicates, which are a staple of p-ABC systems, and tools and guidelines to ease the adaptation process like a validation meta-schema.

Yet many core economic activities—such as uncollateralized lending and building personal brands—are built on persistent, non-transferable relationships. In this paper, we illustrate how non-transferable “soulbound” tokens (SBTs) representing the commitments, credentials, and affiliations of “Souls” can encode the trust networks of the real economy to establish provenance and reputation. More importantly, SBTs enable other applications of increasing ambition, such as community wallet recovery, sybil-resistant governance, mechanisms for decentralization, and novel markets with decomposable, shared rights. We call this richer, pluralistic ecosystem “Decentralized Society” (DeSoc)—a co-determined sociality, where Souls and communities come together bottom-up, as emergent properties of each other to co-create plural network goods and intelligences, at a range of scales. Key to this sociality is decomposable property rights and enhanced governance mechanisms—such as quadratic funding discounted by correlation scores—that reward trust and cooperation while protecting networks from capture, extraction, and domination. With such augmented sociality, web3 can eschew today’s hyper-financialization in favor of a more transformative, pluralist future of increasing returns across social distance.",DI,,3

It combines a blockchain front end with a trusted hardware back end to scrape HTTPS-enabled websites and serve source-authenticated data to relying smart contracts.
