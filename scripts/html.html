national identity cards and/or ePassports; eSIM) is introduced here to
permissionless blockchains in order to remove the inefficiencies of Sybil-
resistant mechanisms such as Proof-of-Work (i.e., high energy and en-
vironmental costs) and Proof-of-Stake (i.e., capital hoarding and lower
transaction volume). The proposed solution effectively limits the number
of mining nodes a single individual would be able to run while keeping
membership open to everyone, circumventing the impossibility of full de-
centralization and the blockchain scalability trilemma when instantiated
on a blockchain with a consensus protocol based on the cryptographic
random selection of nodes. Resistance to collusion is also considered.
Solving one of the most pressing problems in blockchains, a zk-PoI
cryptocurrency is proved to have the following advantageous properties:
- an incentive-compatible protocol for the issuing of cryptocurrency
rewards based on a unique Nash equilibrium
- strict domination of mining over all other PoW/PoS cryptocurrencies,
thus the zk-PoI cryptocurrency becoming the preferred choice by miners
is proved to be a Nash equilibrium and the Evolutionarily Stable Strategy
- PoW/PoS cryptocurrencies are condemned to pay the Price of Crypto-
Anarchy, redeemed by the optimal efficiency of zk-PoI as it implements
the social optimum
- the circulation of a zk-PoI cryptocurrency Pareto dominates other
PoW/PoS cryptocurrencies
- the network effects arising from the social networks inherent to na-
tional identity cards and ePassports dominate PoW/PoS cryptocurrencies
- the lower costs of its infrastructure imply the existence of a unique
equilibrium where it dominates other forms of payment</td><td class="cell-?txd"></td><td class="cell-@i@U"></td><td class="cell-G:qo">no idea</td><td class="cell-&lt;V&gt;{"></td></tr><tr id="bc20fe9c-c34d-48bd-b385-7bca9453d9ec"><td class="cell-title"><a href="Private%20duplicate%20of%20database%208fc3aa72bde64525906231f8da6c51d5/Access%20with%20Fast%20Batch%20Verifiable%20Anonymous%20Creden%20bc20fe9cc34d48bdb3857bca9453d9ec.html">Access with Fast Batch Verifiable Anonymous Credentials</a></td><td class="cell-Zv|V"><a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-540-88625-9">https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-540-88625-9</a></td><td class="cell-XOyH"><span class="selected-value select-value-color-red">Not relevant</span></td><td class="cell-L`&lt;d">2008</td><td class="cell-Xh&gt;J">An anonymous credential-based access control system allows the user to prove possession of credentials to a resource guard that enforce access policies on one or more resources, whereby interactions involving the same user are unlinkable by the resource guard. This paper proposes three fast batch verifiable anonymous credential schemes. With all three schemes, the user can arbitrarily choose a portion of his access rights to prove possession of credentials while the number of expensive cryptographic computations spent is independent of the number of accessx rights being chosen. Moreover, the third anonymous credential scheme is not only fast batch verifiable but also fast fine-grained revocable, which means that to verify whether an arbitrarily chosen subset of credentials is revoked entails constant computation cost.</td><td class="cell-?txd"><span class="selected-value select-value-color-green">VC</span></td><td class="cell-@i@U"><span class="selected-value select-value-color-yellow">Anonymous Credentials</span><span class="selected-value select-value-color-default">Not Sybil resistant</span></td><td class="cell-G:qo">no idea</td><td class="cell-&lt;V&gt;{"></td></tr><tr id="4ae97388-b09d-4b23-8a4f-48be2198fc74"><td class="cell-title"><a href="Private%20duplicate%20of%20database%208fc3aa72bde64525906231f8da6c51d5/Anonymous%20credentials%20light%204ae97388b09d4b238a4f48be2198fc74.html">Anonymous credentials light</a></td><td class="cell-Zv|V"><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2508859.2516687">https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2508859.2516687</a></td><td class="cell-XOyH"><span class="selected-value select-value-color-orange">Maybe relevant</span></td><td class="cell-L`&lt;d">2013</td><td class="cell-Xh&gt;J">We define and propose an efficient and provably secure construction of blind signatures with attributes. Prior notions of blind signatures did not yield themselves to the construction of anonymous credential systems, not even if we drop the unlinkability requirement of anonymous credentials. Our new notion in contrast is a convenient building block for anonymous credential systems. The construction we propose is efficient: it requires just a few exponentiations in a prime-order group in which the decisional Diffie-Hellman problem is hard. Thus, for the first time, we give a provably secure construction of anonymous credentials that can work in the elliptic group setting without bilinear pairings and is based on the DDH assumption. In contrast, prior provably secure constructions were based on the RSA group or on groups with pairings, which made them prohibitively inefficient for mobile devices, RFIDs and smartcards. The only prior efficient construction that could work in such elliptic curve groups, due to Brands, does not have a proof of security.</td><td class="cell-?txd"><span class="selected-value select-value-color-blue">Anonymous Credentials</span></td><td class="cell-@i@U"><span class="selected-value select-value-color-yellow">Anonymous Credentials</span><span class="selected-value select-value-color-red">Signature scheme</span></td><td class="cell-G:qo">no idea</td><td class="cell-&lt;V&gt;{"></td></tr><tr id="57dc6e69-f4de-4fe6-9ad5-db3e41a47caa"><td class="cell-title"><a href="Private%20duplicate%20of%20database%208fc3aa72bde64525906231f8da6c51d5/Burrata%2057dc6e69f4de4fe69ad5db3e41a47caa.html">Burrata</a></td><td class="cell-Zv|V"><a href="https://www.burrata.xyz/">https://www.burrata.xyz/</a></td><td class="cell-XOyH"><span class="selected-value select-value-color-yellow">Relevant</span></td><td class="cell-L`&lt;d">2022</td><td class="cell-Xh&gt;J">Burrata is a network of nodes that can be seen as an integration layer that allows users <strong>to</strong> <strong>bridge web2 identities and private data to web3. </strong></td><td class="cell-?txd"><span class="selected-value select-value-color-orange">DI</span><span class="selected-value select-value-color-gray">Data to Web3</span><span class="selected-value select-value-color-green">VC</span></td><td class="cell-@i@U"><span class="selected-value select-value-color-default">Implementations</span><span class="selected-value select-value-color-green">Legacy compatible</span><span class="selected-value select-value-color-yellow">Linkage of Web2 Ids</span><span class="selected-value select-value-color-purple">Possible tool in larger solution</span><span class="selected-value select-value-color-blue">Worthwile Sybil resistance insights</span></td><td class="cell-G:qo">no idea</td><td class="cell-&lt;V&gt;{"></td></tr><tr id="f0554d05-59da-4a67-80bb-dfbcfbf5edb5"><td class="cell-title"><a href="Private%20duplicate%20of%20database%208fc3aa72bde64525906231f8da6c51d5/CredenceLedger%20A%20Permissioned%20Blockchain%20for%20Verif%20f0554d0559da4a6780bbdfbcfbf5edb5.html">CredenceLedger: A Permissioned Blockchain for Verifiable Academic Credentials</a></td><td class="cell-Zv|V"><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8436324">https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8436324</a></td><td class="cell-XOyH"><span class="selected-value select-value-color-red">Not relevant</span></td><td class="cell-L`&lt;d">2018</td><td class="cell-Xh&gt;J">Blockchain, the underlying technology that powers cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, is gaining so much attention from different industry stakeholders, governments and research communities. Its application is extending beyond cryptocurrencies and has been exploited in different domains such as finance, E-commerce, Internet of Things (IoT), healthcare, and governance. Some key attributes of the technology are decentralization, immutability, security and transparency. This paper aims to describe how permissioned Blockchain can be applied to a specific educational use case - decentralized verification of academic credentials.

Revocation is critical to the security of such systems. We construct a short group signature scheme that supports Verifier-Local Revocation (VLR). In this model, revocation messages are only sent to signature verifiers (as opposed to both signers and verifiers). Consequently there is no need to contact individual signers when some user is revoked. This model is appealing for systems providing attestation capabilities. Our signatures are as short as standard RSA signatures with comparable security. Security of our group signature (in the random oracle model) is based on the Strong Diffie-Hellman assumption and the Decision Linear assumption in bilinear groups. We give a precise model for VLR group signatures and discuss its implications.</td><td class="cell-?txd"><span class="selected-value select-value-color-pink">Signature scheme</span></td><td class="cell-@i@U"><span class="selected-value select-value-color-green">Anonymity revocation</span><span class="selected-value select-value-color-red">Signature scheme</span></td><td class="cell-G:qo">no idea</td><td class="cell-&lt;V&gt;{"></td></tr><tr id="b9e92b27-05de-4445-97e3-3808a115f123"><td class="cell-title"><a href="Private%20duplicate%20of%20database%208fc3aa72bde64525906231f8da6c51d5/Internet%20Engineering%20Task%20Force%20(IETF)%20b9e92b2705de444597e33808a115f123.html">Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)</a></td><td class="cell-Zv|V"><a href="https://www.ietf.org/">https://www.ietf.org/</a></td><td class="cell-XOyH"><span class="selected-value select-value-color-orange">Maybe relevant</span></td><td class="cell-L`&lt;d">NA</td><td class="cell-Xh&gt;J">(Association)</td><td class="cell-?txd"></td><td class="cell-@i@U"><span class="selected-value select-value-color-brown">Standardization efforts</span></td><td class="cell-G:qo">no idea</td><td class="cell-&lt;V&gt;{"></td></tr><tr id="cb420953-64e2-42df-9dba-977d83344bb9"><td class="cell-title"><a href="Private%20duplicate%20of%20database%208fc3aa72bde64525906231f8da6c51d5/Pistis,%20a%20Credentials%20Management%20System%20based%20on%20S%20cb42095364e242df9dba977d83344bb9.html">Pistis, a Credentials Management System based on Self-Sovereign Identity</a></td><td class="cell-Zv|V"><a href="https://www.politesi.polimi.it/bitstream/10589/150517/3/2019_10_Sinico_Taglia.pdf">https://www.politesi.polimi.it/bitstream/10589/150517/3/2019_10_Sinico_Taglia.pdf</a></td><td class="cell-XOyH"><span class="selected-value select-value-color-orange">Maybe relevant</span></td><td class="cell-L`&lt;d">2020</td><td class="cell-Xh&gt;J">This thesis work builds on top of those standards and proposes a new Self Sovereign Identity based credentials management systems running on the Ethereum blockchain: &quot;Pistis&quot;.

These acclaimed proofs, however, are either trivial to falsify or require trust in centralized entities (e.g., search engine caches). This motivates the need for a seamless and standardized internet-wide non-repudiation mechanism, allowing users to share data from news sources, social websites or financial data feeds in a provably secure manner. Additionally, blockchain oracles that enable data-rich smart contracts typically rely on a trusted third party (e.g., TLSNotary or Intel SGX). A decentralized method to transfer webbased content into a permissionless blockchain without additional trusted third party would allow for smart contract applications to flourish. In this work, we present TLS-N, the first TLS extension that provides secure non-repudiation and solves both of the mentioned challenges. TLS-N generates non-interactive proofs about the content of a TLS session that can be efficiently verified by third parties and blockchain based smart contracts. As such, TLS-N increases the accountability for content provided on the web and enables a practical and decentralized blockchain oracle for web content. TLS-N is compatible with TLS 1.3 and adds a minor overhead to a typical TLS session. When a proof is generated, parts of the TLS session (e.g., passwords, cookies) can be hidden for privacy reasons, while the remaining content can be verified.</td><td class="cell-?txd"><span class="selected-value select-value-color-gray">Data to Web3</span></td><td class="cell-@i@U"><span class="selected-value select-value-color-green">Legacy compatible</span><span class="selected-value select-value-color-yellow">Linkage of Web2 Ids</span><span class="selected-value select-value-color-gray">Web2 credentials</span><span class="selected-value select-value-color-pink">Web2 to Web3 data transfer</span></td><td class="cell-G:qo">no idea</td><td class="cell-&lt;V&gt;{"></td></tr><tr id="c92e6fa5-188d-4343-9974-00c738a36760"><td class="cell-title"><a href="Private%20duplicate%20of%20database%208fc3aa72bde64525906231f8da6c51d5/Unclonable%20group%20identification%20c92e6fa5188d4343997400c738a36760.html">Unclonable group identification</a></td><td class="cell-Zv|V"><a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2005/170.pdf">https://eprint.iacr.org/2005/170.pdf</a></td><td class="cell-XOyH"><span class="selected-value select-value-color-orange">Maybe relevant</span></td><td class="cell-L`&lt;d">2005</td><td class="cell-Xh&gt;J">We introduce and motivate the concept of unclonable group identification,

Although the debate about the medical and ethical problems of immunity passports has been widespread, there has been less inspection of the technical foundations of immunity passport schemes. These schemes are envisaged to be used for sharing COVID-19 test and vaccination results in general. The most prominent immunity passport schemes have involved a stack of little-known standards, such as Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs) from the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Our analysis shows that this group of technical identity standards are based on under-specified and often non-standardized documents that have substantial security and privacy issues, due in part to the questionable use of blockchain technology. One concrete proposal for immunity passports is even susceptible to dictionary attacks. The use of cryptography theater&#x27; in efforts like immunity passports, where cryptography is used to allay the privacy concerns of users, should be discouraged in standardization. Deployment of these W3C standards for `self-sovereign identity&#x27; in use-cases like immunity passports could just as well lead to a dangerous form identity totalitarianism.</td><td class="cell-?txd"><span class="selected-value select-value-color-orange">DI</span><span class="selected-value select-value-color-green">VC</span></td><td class="cell-@i@U"><span class="selected-value select-value-color-red">Critique</span><span class="selected-value select-value-color-default">Implementations</span><span class="selected-value select-value-color-brown">Standardization efforts</span></td><td class="cell-G:qo">no idea</td><td class="cell-&lt;V&gt;{"></td></tr><tr id="dd3b14f6-48bb-42cb-87e1-240f2a8c569b"><td class="cell-title"><a href="Private%20duplicate%20of%20database%208fc3aa72bde64525906231f8da6c51d5/zk-creds%20Flexible%20Anonymous%20Credentials%20from%20zkSNA%20dd3b14f648bb42cb87e1240f2a8c569b.html">zk-creds: Flexible Anonymous Credentials from zkSNARKs and Existing Identity Infrastructure</a></td><td class="cell-Zv|V"><a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/878.pdf">https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/878.pdf</a></td><td class="cell-XOyH"><span class="selected-value select-value-color-yellow">Relevant</span></td><td class="cell-L`&lt;d">2022</td><td class="cell-Xh&gt;J">Frequently, users on the web need to show that they are, for example, not a robot, old enough to access an age restricted video, or eligible to download an ebook from their local public library without being tracked. Anonymous credentials were developed to address these concerns. However, existing schemes do not handle the realities of deployment or the complexities of real world identity. Instead, they make (often incorrect) assumptions, e.g., that the local department of motor vehicles will issue sophisticated cryptographic tokens to show users are over 18. In reality, there are multiple trust sources for a given identity attribute, their credentials have distinctively different formats, and many, if not all, issuers are unwilling to adopt new protocols. We present and build zk-creds, a protocol that uses general-purpose zero-knowledge proofs to 1) remove the need for credential issuers to hold signing keys: credentials can be issued via a transparency log, Byzantine system, or even a blockchain; 2) convert existing identity documents into anonymous credentials without modifying documents or coordinating with their issuing authority; 3) allow for flexible, composable, and complex identity statements over multiple credentials. Concretely, identity assertions using zk-creds take less than 300ms in a real-world scenario of using a passport to anonymously access age-restricted videos.</td><td class="cell-?txd"><span class="selected-value select-value-color-blue">Anonymous Credentials</span></td><td class="cell-@i@U"><span class="selected-value select-value-color-yellow">Anonymous Credentials</span><span class="selected-value select-value-color-green">Legacy compatible</span><span class="selected-value select-value-color-purple">Possible tool in larger solution</span><span class="selected-value select-value-color-blue">Worthwile Sybil resistance insights</span></td><td class="cell-G:qo">no idea</td><td class="cell-&lt;V&gt;{"></td></tr><tr id="006063b7-d9ed-4dfb-af32-d690b47b3558"><td class="cell-title"><a href="Private%20duplicate%20of%20database%208fc3aa72bde64525906231f8da6c51d5/TLS%20Notary%20006063b7d9ed4dfbaf32d690b47b3558.html">TLS Notary</a></td><td class="cell-Zv|V"><a href="https://tlsnotary.github.io/docs-mdbook/">https://tlsnotary.github.io/docs-mdbook/</a></td><td class="cell-XOyH"><span class="selected-value select-value-color-yellow">Relevant</span></td><td class="cell-L`&lt;d"></td><td class="cell-Xh&gt;J">TLSNotary is a browser add-on which allows you (the auditee) to prove to the auditor that a certain HTTPS page is present in a web browser, without compromising your internet connection, passwords or credentials.

In particular, we develop an approval voting inspired selection mechanism through which the experts approve or disapprove the different updates according to their perception of the quality of each alternative. Given their opinions, and weighted by their expertise level, a single update is then implemented and evaluated, and the experts receive rewards based on their choices. We show that this mechanism always has approximate pure Nash equilibria and that these achieve a constant factor approximation with respect to the quality benchmark of the optimal alternative. Finally, we study the repeated version of the problem, where the weights of the experts are adjusted after each update, according to their performance. Under mild assumptions about the weights, the extension of our mechanism still has approximate pure Nash equilibria in this setting.&#x27;&#x27; Abstract from <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-15714-1_23">https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-15714-1_23</a>.</td><td class="cell-?txd"></td><td class="cell-@i@U"></td><td class="cell-G:qo">no idea</td><td class="cell-&lt;V&gt;{"></td></tr><tr id="d395baee-58f2-4d07-9c40-f072c5e84cab"><td class="cell-title"><a href="Private%20duplicate%20of%20database%208fc3aa72bde64525906231f8da6c51d5/EBSI%20(joint%20initiative%20from%20the%20European%20Commissio%20d395baee58f24d079c40f072c5e84cab.html">EBSI (joint initiative from the European Commission and the European Blockchain Partnership) </a></td><td class="cell-Zv|V"><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/wikis/display/EBSIDOC/EBSI+Verifiable+Credentials+Explained">https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/wikis/display/EBSIDOC/EBSI+Verifiable+Credentials+Playbook</a></td><td class="cell-XOyH"><span class="selected-value select-value-color-yellow">Relevant</span></td><td class="cell-L`&lt;d"></td><td class="cell-Xh&gt;J">This playbook presents the DIDs and Verifiable Credentials technology that is built on EBSI.

Unauthorised access to resources can cause significant disruption and/or disastrous consequences. Given the importance of protecting these secrets to the security and privacy of many software systems, many solutions have been proposed. These solutions take two main directions: either securely store the secret and implement an access control mechanism, or divide the secret into a set of shares and distribute them in different machines (such as the Shamir’s secret sharing approach or multi-party computation MPC). However, apart from the MPC approach, they all share the same limitation: once the consumer receives the secret, it can be leaked and be used by any malicious actor. We believe that the secret management should not be centralised and that the secret should never be sent to the receiver. Therefore, in this paper we propose, Secretation, a new approach for managing the secrets in a decentralised way by leveraging decentralised identity concepts such as verifiable credential technologies, password-authenticated key exchange protocols and multi-party computation. The result is a more scalable and secure solution that significantly reduces the risk of leaking the secrets.&#x27;&#x27;

The main limitation of this paper for our case is that the issuer is considered trusted and needs to sign a message or retain a private state.</td><td class="cell-?txd"><span class="selected-value select-value-color-orange">DI</span><span class="selected-value select-value-color-green">VC</span></td><td class="cell-@i@U"><span class="selected-value select-value-color-yellow">Anonymous Credentials</span><span class="selected-value select-value-color-gray">Centralized/permissioned</span><span class="selected-value select-value-color-blue">Worthwile Sybil resistance insights</span></td><td class="cell-G:qo">no idea</td><td class="cell-&lt;V&gt;{"></td></tr><tr id="ab5ac109-b61f-4774-9e70-1f6c9b13be0a"><td class="cell-title"><a href="Private%20duplicate%20of%20database%208fc3aa72bde64525906231f8da6c51d5/A%20Signature%20Scheme%20With%20Efficient%20Protocols%20ab5ac109b61f47749e701f6c9b13be0a.html">A Signature Scheme With Efficient Protocols</a></td><td class="cell-Zv|V"><a href="https://cs.brown.edu/people/alysyans/papers/camlys02b.pdf">https://cs.brown.edu/people/alysyans/papers/camlys02b.pdf</a></td><td class="cell-XOyH"><span class="selected-value select-value-color-red">Not relevant</span></td><td class="cell-L`&lt;d">2002</td><td class="cell-Xh&gt;J"></td><td class="cell-?txd"><span class="selected-value select-value-color-blue">Anonymous Credentials</span><span class="selected-value select-value-color-brown">Classic reference</span></td><td class="cell-@i@U"><span class="selected-value select-value-color-yellow">Anonymous Credentials</span><span class="selected-value select-value-color-pink">Classic reference</span></td><td class="cell-G:qo">no idea</td><td class="cell-&lt;V&gt;{"></td></tr><tr id="86d5c672-2717-4014-948e-3bbdf7eca33c"><td class="cell-title"><a href="Private%20duplicate%20of%20database%208fc3aa72bde64525906231f8da6c51d5/A%20Survey%20on%20Non-transferable%20Anonymous%20Credentials%2086d5c67227174014948e3bbdf7eca33c.html">A Survey on Non-transferable Anonymous Credentials</a></td><td class="cell-Zv|V"><a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-03315-5_8">https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-03315-5_8</a></td><td class="cell-XOyH"><span class="selected-value select-value-color-red">Not relevant</span></td><td class="cell-L`&lt;d">2022</td><td class="cell-Xh&gt;J">There are at least two principal approaches to prevent users from sharing their anonymous credentials: adding valuable secrets into the system the user does not want to share or embedding biometric access control. This paper seeks to identify possible fields of application and to compare both approaches with respect to the credentials’ non-transferability.
The paper shows that both approaches do not ensure the non- transferability of anonymous credentials, but may be applicable in some fields. On the one hand, it might be hard to find valuable secrets to really prevent the sharing of credentials, in particular with close family members. On the other hand, biometric sensors embedded in a smartcard can be circumvented with some effort, especially if access control is unattended. Although the combination of both approaches may prevent more users from sharing their credentials, it suffers from restrictions of both approaches and from the effort needed to put it in place.
However, assuming that anonymous credentials will probably not be used in high-security environments, both approaches might be sufficient to prevent sharing in some applications. If the users already possess personal digital assistants, embedded valuable secrets are a quite cheap solution, even though they raise the system’s value. If access control is attended, biometric sensors are reasonably safe and limit the possibility of unintentionally sharing the credentials for free.</td><td class="cell-?txd"><span class="selected-value select-value-color-blue">Anonymous Credentials</span></td><td class="cell-@i@U"></td><td class="cell-G:qo">no idea</td><td class="cell-&lt;V&gt;{"></td></tr><tr id="28c9469e-8a79-41ff-bc03-39af422c3a96"><td class="cell-title"><a href="Private%20duplicate%20of%20database%208fc3aa72bde64525906231f8da6c51d5/An%20Active%20Preference%20Learning%20Approach%20to%20Aid%20the%20%2028c9469e8a7941ffbc0339af422c3a96.html">An Active Preference Learning Approach to Aid the Selection of Validators in Blockchain Environments</a></td><td class="cell-Zv|V"><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4253515">https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4253515</a></td><td class="cell-XOyH"><span class="selected-value select-value-color-orange">Maybe relevant</span></td><td class="cell-L`&lt;d"></td><td class="cell-Xh&gt;J"></td><td class="cell-?txd"></td><td class="cell-@i@U"></td><td class="cell-G:qo">no idea</td><td class="cell-&lt;V&gt;{"></td></tr><tr id="a3d973a8-8c2c-4850-84f3-e8ebfffdfa77"><td class="cell-title"><a href="Private%20duplicate%20of%20database%208fc3aa72bde64525906231f8da6c51d5/An%20Efficient%20System%20for%20Non-transferable%20Anonymous%20a3d973a88c2c485084f3e8ebfffdfa77.html">An Efficient System for Non-transferable Anonymous Credentials with Optional Anonymity Revocation</a></td><td class="cell-Zv|V"><a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-44987-6_7">https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-44987-6_7</a></td><td class="cell-XOyH"><span class="selected-value select-value-color-orange">Maybe relevant</span></td><td class="cell-L`&lt;d">2001</td><td class="cell-Xh&gt;J">A credential system is a system in which users can obtain credentials from organizations and demonstrate possession of these credentials. Such a system is anonymous when transactions carried out by the same user cannot be linked. An anonymous credential system is of significant practical relevance because it is the best means of providing privacy for users. In this paper we propose a practical anonymous credential system that is based on the strong RSA assumption and the decisional Diffie-Hellman assumption modulo a safe prime product and is considerably superior to existing ones: (1) We give the first practical solution that allows a user to unlinkably demonstrate possession of a credential as many times as necessary without involving the issuing organization. (2) To prevent misuse of anonymity, our scheme is the first to offer optional anonymity revocation for particular transactions. (3) Our scheme offers separability: all organizations can choose their cryptographic keys independently of each other. Moreover, we suggest more effective means of preventing users from sharing their credentials, by introducing <em>all-or-nothing</em>
 sharing: a user who allows a friend to use one of her credentials once, gives him the ability to use all of her credentials, i.e., taking over her identity. This is implemented by a new primitive, called <em>circular encryption</em>, which is of independent interest, and can be realized from any semantically secure cryptosystem in the random oracle model.</td><td class="cell-?txd"><span class="selected-value select-value-color-blue">Anonymous Credentials</span></td><td class="cell-@i@U"><span class="selected-value select-value-color-green">Anonymity revocation</span><span class="selected-value select-value-color-yellow">Anonymous Credentials</span><span class="selected-value select-value-color-purple">Credential sharing prevention</span></td><td class="cell-G:qo">no idea</td><td class="cell-&lt;V&gt;{"></td></tr><tr id="4cd22e80-3296-4099-bd94-8ce6eb98c3e5"><td class="cell-title"><a href="Private%20duplicate%20of%20database%208fc3aa72bde64525906231f8da6c51d5/Anonymous%20credentials%20with%20type-3%20revocation%204cd22e8032964099bd948ce6eb98c3e5.html">Anonymous credentials with type-3 revocation</a></td><td class="cell-Zv|V"><a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/ursa-docs/tree/main/specs/anoncreds1">https://github.com/hyperledger/ursa-docs/tree/main/specs/anoncreds1</a></td><td class="cell-XOyH"><span class="selected-value select-value-color-orange">Maybe relevant</span></td><td class="cell-L`&lt;d">2022</td><td class="cell-Xh&gt;J">N/A</td><td class="cell-?txd"><span class="selected-value select-value-color-blue">Anonymous Credentials</span></td><td class="cell-@i@U"></td><td class="cell-G:qo">no idea</td><td class="cell-&lt;V&gt;{"></td></tr><tr id="dc489a6f-dc41-41a5-b244-5f555876c88a"><td class="cell-title"><a href="Private%20duplicate%20of%20database%208fc3aa72bde64525906231f8da6c51d5/Distributed-Ledger-based%20Authentication%20with%20Decen%20dc489a6fdc4141a5b2445f555876c88a.html">Distributed-Ledger-based Authentication with Decentralized Identifiers and Verifiable Credentials</a></td><td class="cell-Zv|V"><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9223292">https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9223292</a></td><td class="cell-XOyH"><span class="selected-value select-value-color-red">Not relevant</span></td><td class="cell-L`&lt;d">2020</td><td class="cell-Xh&gt;J">Authentication with username and password is becoming an inconvenient process for the user.

At the same time, it is infeasible to find a witness for a value that was not accumulated. We put forward the notion of a dynamic accumulator, which is an accumulator that allows one to dynamically add and delete inputs, such that the cost of an add or delete is independent of the number of accumulated values. We achieve this under the strong RSA assumption. For this construction, we also show an efficient zero-knowledge protocol for proving that a committed value is in the accumulator. Dynamic accumulators enable efficient membership revocation in the anonymous setting. Our construction is especially suitable for membership revocation in group signature and identity escrow schemes, such as the one due to Ateniese et al. [ACJT00], and efficient revocation of credentials in anonymous credential systems, such as the one due to Camenisch and Lysyanskaya [CL01a]. Applying our method to these schemes enables membership revocation and yet does not significantly increase the complexity of any of the operations. In particular, the cost of a membership verification or credential
showing increases by only a small constant factor, less than 2. All previously known methods (such as the ones due to Bresson and Stern [BS01] and Ateniese and Tsudik [AT01]) incur an increase in these costs that is linear in the number of members.</td><td class="cell-?txd"><span class="selected-value select-value-color-blue">Anonymous Credentials</span></td><td class="cell-@i@U"></td><td class="cell-G:qo">no idea</td><td class="cell-&lt;V&gt;{"></td></tr><tr id="8ccbadab-8c94-44b8-9634-a2424ae73205"><td class="cell-title"><a href="Private%20duplicate%20of%20database%208fc3aa72bde64525906231f8da6c51d5/Jolocom%208ccbadab8c9444b89634a2424ae73205.html">Jolocom</a></td><td class="cell-Zv|V"><a href="https://jolocom.io/">https://jolocom.io/</a></td><td class="cell-XOyH"><span class="selected-value select-value-color-red">Not relevant</span></td><td class="cell-L`&lt;d"></td><td class="cell-Xh&gt;J">Jolocom develops an open source protocol for

Digital signature schemes are a fundamental cryptographic primitive, of use both in its own right, and as a building block in cryp-tographic protocol design. In this paper, we propose a practical and provably secure signature scheme and show protocols (1) for issuing a signature on a committed value (so the signer has no information about the signed value), and (2) for proving knowledge of a signature on a committed value. This signature scheme and corresponding protocols are a building block for the design of anonymity-enhancing cryptographic sys-tems, such as electronic cash, group signatures, and anonymous creden-tial systems. The security of our signature scheme and protocols relies on the Strong RSA assumption.

We identify three major veins in the research literature that describe ways to defend against the attack: using trusted certification, using resource testing, and using social networks. The first vein in the literature considers defending against the attack using trusted certification, which is done by either centralized certification or distributed certification using cryptographic primitives that can replace the centralized certification entity. The second vein in the literature considers defending against the attack by testing resources, which can
be in the form of IP testing, network coordinates, or recurring cost (e.g., by requiring clients to solve puzzles). The third and last vein in the literature is by mitigating the attack, combining social
networks used as bootstrap security and tools from random walk theory, which was shown to be effective in defending against the attack under certain assumptions. Our survey and analyses of the different schemes in the three veins in the literature show several shortcomings, which form several interesting directions and research questions worthy of investigation.</td><td class="cell-?txd"></td><td class="cell-@i@U"></td><td class="cell-G:qo">no idea</td><td class="cell-&lt;V&gt;{"></td></tr><tr id="2b002bb5-8dc4-4774-a64a-4f7c76c56b5f"><td class="cell-title"><a href="Private%20duplicate%20of%20database%208fc3aa72bde64525906231f8da6c51d5/Towards%20Smart%20Contract-based%20Verification%20of%20Anony%202b002bb58dc44774a64a4f7c76c56b5f.html">Towards Smart Contract-based Verification of Anonymous Credentials</a></td><td class="cell-Zv|V"><a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/492.pdf">https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/492.pdf</a></td><td class="cell-XOyH"><span class="selected-value select-value-color-orange">Maybe relevant</span></td><td class="cell-L`&lt;d">2022</td><td class="cell-Xh&gt;J">Smart contracts often need to verify identity-related information of their users.

Given the isolation and privacy limitations of blockchain technologies, this presents a problem for on-chain verification. In this paper, we show how CL-signature-based anonymous credentials can
be verified in smart contracts using the example of Hyperledger Indy, a decentralized credential management platform, and Ethereum, a smart contract-enabled
blockchain. Therefore, we first outline how smart contract-based verification can be integrated in the Hyperledger Indy credential management routine and, then, provide a technical evaluation based on a proof-of-concept implementation of CL-signature verification on Ethereum. While our results demonstrate technical feasibility of smart contract-based verification of anonymous credentials, they also reveal technical barriers for its real-world usage.</td><td class="cell-?txd"><span class="selected-value select-value-color-blue">Anonymous Credentials</span></td><td class="cell-@i@U"><span class="selected-value select-value-color-purple">Possible tool in larger solution</span><span class="selected-value select-value-color-purple">Smart Contracts instead of oracles</span><span class="selected-value select-value-color-blue">Worthwile Sybil resistance insights</span></td><td class="cell-G:qo">no idea</td><td class="cell-&lt;V&gt;{"></td></tr><tr id="ae525b92-c245-4400-8f26-f90bf8c54d02"><td class="cell-title"><a href="Private%20duplicate%20of%20database%208fc3aa72bde64525906231f8da6c51d5/Verifiable%20Contracting%20ae525b92c24544008f26f90bf8c54d02.html">Verifiable Contracting</a></td><td class="cell-Zv|V"><a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-66504-3_8">https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-66504-3_8</a></td><td class="cell-XOyH"><span class="selected-value select-value-color-red">Not relevant</span></td><td class="cell-L`&lt;d">2020</td><td class="cell-Xh&gt;J">We investigate the combined use of eIDAS-based electronic identity and Verifiable Credentials for remote onboarding and contracting, and provide a proof-of-concept implementation based on SAML authentication.

However, the excessive pursuit of self-sovereignty in the most existing SSI schemes hinders sanctions against attackers. To deal with the malicious behavior, a few SSI schemes introduce accountability mechanisms, but they sacrifice users’ privacy. In addition, the digital identities (static strings or updatable chains) in the existing SSI schemes are as inputs to a third-party executable program (mobile app, smart contract, etc.) to achieve identity reading, storing and proving, and users’ self-sovereignty are weakened. To solve the above problems, we present a new self-sovereign identity scheme to strike a balance between privacy and accountability and get rid of the dependence on the third-party program. In our scheme, one and only individual-specific executable code is generated as a digital avatar-i for each human to interact with others in cyberspace without a third-party program, in which the embedding of biometrics enhances uniqueness and user control over their identity. In addition, a joint accountability mechanism, which is based on the shamir (t, n) threshold algorithm and a consortium blockchain, is designed to restrict the power of each regulatory authority and protect users’ privacy. Finally, we analyze the security, SSI properties and conduct detailed experiments in terms of the cost of computation, storage, and blockchain gas. The analysis results indicate that our scheme resists the known attacks and fulfills all the six SSI properties. Compared with the state-of-the-art schemes, the extensive experiment results show that the cost is larger in server storage, blockchain storage, and blockchain gas, but is still low enough for practical situations.</td><td class="cell-?txd"></td><td class="cell-@i@U"></td><td class="cell-G:qo">no idea</td><td class="cell-&lt;V&gt;{"></td></tr><tr id="6ca280c5-c8b7-4cfe-921a-6d4da110e576"><td class="cell-title"><a href="Private%20duplicate%20of%20database%208fc3aa72bde64525906231f8da6c51d5/Permissionless%20Blockchain-Based%20Sybil-Resistant%20Se%206ca280c5c8b74cfe921a6d4da110e576.html">Permissionless Blockchain-Based Sybil-Resistant Self-Sovereign Identity Utilizing Attested Execution Secure Processors</a></td><td class="cell-Zv|V"><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9881847">https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9881847</a></td><td class="cell-XOyH"><span class="selected-value select-value-color-red">Not relevant</span></td><td class="cell-L`&lt;d">2022</td><td class="cell-Xh&gt;J">The current circumstance that requires people more

Metadium project is an identity project composed of a<strong> </strong>public blockchain ID platform, a Meta ID protocol<strong>,</strong> and service application.</td><td class="cell-?txd"></td><td class="cell-@i@U"></td><td class="cell-G:qo">no idea</td><td class="cell-&lt;V&gt;{"></td></tr><tr id="67c1cb70-9b8f-48a6-a37e-af9a4fe780b2"><td class="cell-title"><a href="Private%20duplicate%20of%20database%208fc3aa72bde64525906231f8da6c51d5/KILT%2067c1cb709b8f48a6a37eaf9a4fe780b2.html">KILT</a></td><td class="cell-Zv|V"><a href="https://docs.kilt.io/docs/concepts/what-is-kilt">https://docs.kilt.io/docs/concepts/what-is-kilt</a></td><td class="cell-XOyH"><span class="selected-value select-value-color-yellow">Relevant</span></td><td class="cell-L`&lt;d"></td><td class="cell-Xh&gt;J">KILT is a protocol for self-sovereign data and interoperability built on top of the permissionless KILT blockchain.

However, a limitation of today’s anonymous credential systems is the need for a trusted credential issuer — which is both a single point of failure and a target for compromise. Furthermore, the need for such a trusted issuer can make it challenging to deploy credential systems in practice, particularly in the ad hoc network setting (e.g., anonymous peer-to-peer networks) where no single party can be trusted with this responsibility.<mark class="highlight-yellow_background"> In this work we propose a novel anonymous credential scheme that eliminates the need for a trusted credential issuer. Our approach builds on recent results in the area of electronic cash that, given a public append-only ledger, do not need a trusted credential issuer.</mark> Furthermore, given a distributed public ledger, as in, e.g., Bitcoin, our system requires no credential issuer at all and hence is decentralized. Using such a public ledger and standard cryptographic primitives, we propose and provide a proof of security for a basic anonymous credential system that allows users to make flexible identity assertions with strong privacy guarantees without relying on trusted parties. Finally, we discuss a number of practical applications for our techniques, including resource management in ad hoc networks and prevention of Sybil attacks.

Recent works have leveraged social network-based trust relationships to defend against Sybil attacks. However, existing defenses are based on oversimplified assumptions about network structure, which do not necessarily hold in real-world social networks. Recognizing these limitations, we propose SYBILFUSE, a defense-in-depth framework for Sybil detection when the oversimplified assumptions are relaxed. SYBILFUSE adopts a collective classification approach by first training local classifiers to compute local trust scores for nodes and edges, and then propagating the local scores through the global network structure via weighted random walk and loopy belief propagation mechanisms. We evaluate our framework on both synthetic and real-world network topologies, including a large-scale, labeled Twitter network comprising 20M nodes and 265M edges, and demonstrate that SYBILFUSE outperforms state-of-the-art approaches significantly. In particular, SYBILFUSE achieves 98% of Sybil coverage among top-ranked nodes.</td><td class="cell-?txd"><span class="selected-value select-value-color-red">Sybil resistance</span></td><td class="cell-@i@U"></td><td class="cell-G:qo">no idea</td><td class="cell-&lt;V&gt;{"></td></tr><tr id="5935915f-6b50-4ae0-aeb0-be1f14788ef3"><td class="cell-title"><a href="Private%20duplicate%20of%20database%208fc3aa72bde64525906231f8da6c51d5/ZEBRA%20Anonymous%20Credentials%20with%20Practical%20On-chai%205935915f6b504ae0aeb0be1f14788ef3.html">ZEBRA: Anonymous Credentials with Practical On-chain Verification and Applications to KYC in DeFi</a></td><td class="cell-Zv|V"><a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/1286">https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/1286</a></td><td class="cell-XOyH"><span class="selected-value select-value-color-yellow">Relevant</span></td><td class="cell-L`&lt;d">2022</td><td class="cell-Xh&gt;J">ZEBRA is an Anonymous Credential (AC) scheme, supporting auditability and revocation, that provides practical on-chain verification for the first time. It realizes efficient access control on permissionless blockchains while achieving both privacy and accountability. In all prior solutions, users either pay exorbitant fees or lose privacy since authorities granting access can map users to their wallets. Hence, ZEBRA is the first to enable DeFi platforms to remain compliant with imminent regulations without compromising user privacy.
We evaluate ZEBRA and show that it reduces the gas cost incurred on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) by 11.8x when compared to Coconut [NDSS 2019], the state-of-the-art AC scheme for blockchains. This translates to a reduction in transaction fees from 94 USD to 8 USD on Ethereum in August 2022. However, 8 USD is still high for most applications, and ZEBRA further drives down credential verification costs through batched verification. For a batch of 512 layer-1 and layer-2 wallets, the gas cost is reduced by 35x and 641x on EVM, and the transaction fee is reduced to just 0.23 USD and 0.0126 USD on Ethereum, respectively.

It is proved that the privacy of individuals is protected in a way that is optimal against cooperation of all organizations, even if the organizations have infinite computational resources. We introduce a “formal credential mechanism”, based on an “ideal RSA cryptosystem”. It allows individuals a chance of successful cheating that is proved to be exponentially small in the amount of computation required.

Furthermore, users can frequently perform fraud without severe consequence. Reputation systems only solve this problem partially as malicious users can re-join the network with a new identity if their reputation is too low. By performing a Sybil attack, i.e., joining with multiple seemingly distinct identities, malicious participants can further boost their own reputation.

In this paper, we present <em>MarketPalace</em>. MarketPalace relies on a peer-to-peer infrastructure to realize a decentralized market place during trading. Only when registering, users communicate with a central server to verify that they are not Sybils. More concretely, our system leverages self-sovereign identity to detect
and undermine repeated joins by the same user.

Some existing decentralized oracle protocols make use of majority-voting schemes to determine the outcomes and/or rewards to participants. In these cases, the awards (or penalties) grow linearly to the participant stakes, therefore voters are indifferent between voting through a single or multiple identities. Furthermore, the voters receive a reward only when they agree with the majority outcome, a tactic that may lead to herd behavior. This paper proposes an oracle protocol based on peer prediction mechanisms with non-linear staking rules. In the proposed approach, instead of being rewarded when agreeing with a majority outcome, a voter receives awards when their report achieves a relatively high score based on a peer prediction scoring scheme. The scoring scheme is designed to be incentive compatible so that the maximized expected score is achieved only with honest reporting. A non-linear stake scaling rule is proposed to discourage Sybil attacks. This paper also provides a theoretical analysis and guidelines for implementation as reference.</td><td class="cell-?txd"><span class="selected-value select-value-color-purple">Oracles</span></td><td class="cell-@i@U"><span class="selected-value select-value-color-red">Collusion prevention</span><span class="selected-value select-value-color-blue">Worthwile Sybil resistance insights</span></td><td class="cell-G:qo">no idea</td><td class="cell-&lt;V&gt;{"></td></tr><tr id="23c549c0-ffc2-4f6d-bab1-8111af8f6335"><td class="cell-title"><a href="Private%20duplicate%20of%20database%208fc3aa72bde64525906231f8da6c51d5/Blockchain-Based%20Verifiable%20Credential%20Sharing%20wit%2023c549c0ffc24f6dbab18111af8f6335.html">Blockchain-Based Verifiable Credential Sharing with Selective Disclosure</a></td><td class="cell-Zv|V"><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9343074">https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9343074</a></td><td class="cell-XOyH"><span class="selected-value select-value-color-yellow">Relevant</span></td><td class="cell-L`&lt;d">2020</td><td class="cell-Xh&gt;J">Sharing credentials could raise privacy concerns.

Beyond the verification of identities and credentials, a flexible selective disclosure solution is proposed using redactable signatures. The credentials are managed through a decentralised application/wallet which allows users to store their credential data privately under their full control and re-use as necessary.

Recently, a self-sovereign identity model has been researched actively as an alternative to the existing identity models such as a centralized identity model, federated identity model, and user-centric model.  The self-sovereign identity model allows a user to have complete control of his identity. Meanwhile, the core component of the self-sovereign identity model is data minimization. The data minimization signifies that the extent of the exposure of user private identity should be minimized. As a solution to data minimization, zero-knowledge proofs can be grafted to the self-sovereign identity model. Specifically, zero-knowledge Succinct Non-interactive ARgument of Knowledges(zk-SNARKs) enables proving the truth of the statement on an arbitrary relation. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving self-sovereign identity model based on zkSNARKs to allow any type of data minimization beyond the selective disclosure and range proof. The security of proposed model is formally proven under the security of the zero-knowledge proof and the unforgeability of the signature in the random oracle model. Furthermore, we optimize the proving time by checking the correctness of the commitment outside of the proof relation for practical use. The resulting scheme improves proving time for hash computation (to verify a commitment input) from 0.5 s to about 0.1 ms on a 32-bit input.</td><td class="cell-?txd"><span class="selected-value select-value-color-blue">Anonymous Credentials</span></td><td class="cell-@i@U"></td><td class="cell-G:qo">no idea</td><td class="cell-&lt;V&gt;{"></td></tr><tr id="298e43f2-8111-40d3-85da-a381916efda5"><td class="cell-title"><a href="Private%20duplicate%20of%20database%208fc3aa72bde64525906231f8da6c51d5/Sovrin%20digital%20identities%20in%20the%20blockchain%20era%20298e43f2811140d385daa381916efda5.html">Sovrin : digital identities in the blockchain era</a></td><td class="cell-Zv|V"><a href="https://sovrin.org/wp-content/uploads/AnonCred-RWC.pdf">https://sovrin.org/wp-content/uploads/AnonCred-RWC.pdf</a></td><td class="cell-XOyH"><span class="selected-value select-value-color-red">Not relevant</span></td><td class="cell-L`&lt;d">2016</td><td class="cell-Xh&gt;J">In this paper we describe a practical digital identity project of a global scale, which solves a number of privacy and scalability problems using the concepts of anonymous credentials and permissioned blockchains.

We used sybilhunter’s diverse analysis techniques to analyze

Our findings include diverse Sybils, ranging from botnets, to academic research, and relays that hijacked Bitcoin transactions.

However, plain certificates provide a binary identification: either the whole identity of the subject is known, or nothing is known. We propose using a Merkle hash tree structure, whereby it is possible for a single certificate to contain many separate claims or attributes, each of which may be proved independently, without revealing the others. Additionally, we demonstrate how trees from multiple sources can be combined together by modifying the tree structure. This allows claims by different authorities, such as an employer or professional organization, to be combined under a single certificate, without the CA needing to know (or to verify) all of the claims. In addition to describing the hash tree structure and protocols for constructing and verifying our proposed credential, we formally prove that it provides unforgeability and privacy and we present performance results demonstrating its efficiency. As services move from user names and passwords to attribute-based identity verification, efficiency and scalability of claims verification will become a major issue. We have implemented a prototype client-server system, deployed the prototype in Emulab, and evaluated the server-side throughput for attribute-based identity verification. The results show that our approach can perform about 200 identity verifications per second, while the best competing approach can perform only about 2--5 verifications per second. Our approach is, therefore, better suited to today&#x27;s high-volume Web-based services that demand the highest possible throughput.</td><td class="cell-?txd"><span class="selected-value select-value-color-green">VC</span></td><td class="cell-@i@U"></td><td class="cell-G:qo">no idea</td><td class="cell-&lt;V&gt;{"></td></tr><tr id="01a1f7ab-87de-4d58-920d-455a1dbaa678"><td class="cell-title"><a href="Private%20duplicate%20of%20database%208fc3aa72bde64525906231f8da6c51d5/Notebook%20Labs%2001a1f7ab87de4d58920d455a1dbaa678.html">Notebook Labs</a></td><td class="cell-Zv|V"><a href="https://assets.website-files.com/635b21dddd46c8cddf2171fd/635b21dddd46c8be9021722c_Notebook_Whitepaper.pdf">https://assets.website-files.com/635b21dddd46c8cddf2171fd/635b21dddd46c8be9021722c_Notebook_Whitepaper.pdf</a></td><td class="cell-XOyH"><span class="selected-value select-value-color-green">Very relevant</span></td><td class="cell-L`&lt;d"></td><td class="cell-Xh&gt;J">This technical whitepaper presents Notebook, a novel protocol for Sybil-resistant log-in and credential aggregation that preserves user anonymity.

Most of these attacks were not carefully executed and Tor
directory authority operators were quick to detect and block
the malignant relays. However, the Tor network lacks sophisticated tools to detect and protect against Sybil attacks.
As a result, more advanced attacks could remain undetected.
While there is a large body of work dedicated to defending
against Sybil attacks in peer-to-peer networks, most proposals do not apply to the Tor network as there is no underlying
trust relationship between Tor relays. We propose tools to
detect Sybils and use them to analyse archived relay descriptors. These tools not only help us gain insights about past

Despite the decentralized and trustless architectures of the blockchain systems, smart contracts on their own cannot access data from the external world. Instead, smart contracts interact with off-chain external data sources, called oracles, whose primary job is to collect and provide data feeds and input to smart contracts. However, there is always risk of oracles providing corrupt, malicious, or inaccurate data. In this paper, we analyze and present the notion of trust in the oracles used in blockchain ecosystems. We analyze and compare trust-enabling features of the leading blockchain oracle approaches, techniques, and platforms.

Existing and proposed approaches also presume the spontaneous availability of a credential-issuance ecosystem, creating a bootstrapping problem. They also omit essential functionality, like resistance to Sybil attacks and the ability to detect misbehaving or sanctioned users while preserving user privacy. CanDID addresses these challenges by issuing credentials
in a user-friendly way that draws securely and privately on data from existing, unmodified web service providers. Such legacy compatibility similarly enables CanDID users to leverage their existing online accounts for recovery of lost keys. Using a decentralized committee of nodes, CanDID provides strong confidentiality for user’s keys, real-world identities, and data, yet prevents users from spawning multiple identities and allows identification (and blacklisting) of sanctioned users.

What they cannot do, however, is prove to third parties the provenance of such data, i.e., that it genuinely came from a particular website. Existing approaches either introduce undesirable trust assumptions or require server-side modifications. As a result, the value of users&#x27; private data is locked up in its point of origin. Users cannot export their data with preserved integrity to other applications without help and permission from the current data holder. We propose DECO (short for decentralized oracle to address the above problems. DECO allows users to prove that a piece of data accessed via TLS came from a particular website and optionally prove statements about such data in zero-knowledge, keeping the data itself secret. DECO is the first such system that works without trusted hardware or server-side modifications. DECO can liberate data from centralized web-service silos, making it accessible to a rich spectrum of applications. To demonstrate the power of DECO, we implement three applications that are hard to achieve without it: a private financial instrument using smart contracts, converting legacy credentials to anonymous credentials, and verifiable claims against price discrimination.</td><td class="cell-?txd"><span class="selected-value select-value-color-orange">DI</span><span class="selected-value select-value-color-gray">Data to Web3</span></td><td class="cell-@i@U"><span class="selected-value select-value-color-default">Implementations</span><span class="selected-value select-value-color-green">Legacy compatible</span><span class="selected-value select-value-color-orange">Management of credentials</span><span class="selected-value select-value-color-purple">Possible tool in larger solution</span><span class="selected-value select-value-color-blue">Worthwile Sybil resistance insights</span></td><td class="cell-G:qo">no idea</td><td class="cell-&lt;V&gt;{"></td></tr><tr id="5c6aaa2f-a588-4d85-80d3-f50e0023cc66"><td class="cell-title"><a href="Private%20duplicate%20of%20database%208fc3aa72bde64525906231f8da6c51d5/P-signatures%20and%20Noninteractive%20Anonymous%20Credenti%205c6aaa2fa5884d8580d3f50e0023cc66.html">P-signatures and Noninteractive Anonymous Credentials</a></td><td class="cell-Zv|V"><a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-78524-8_20">https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-78524-8_20</a></td><td class="cell-XOyH"><span class="selected-value select-value-color-orange">Maybe relevant</span></td><td class="cell-L`&lt;d">2008</td><td class="cell-Xh&gt;J"></td><td class="cell-?txd"><span class="selected-value select-value-color-blue">Anonymous Credentials</span></td><td class="cell-@i@U"></td><td class="cell-G:qo">no idea</td><td class="cell-&lt;V&gt;{"></td></tr><tr id="b4f3c3de-2c9e-4f6f-80b7-ab952cd2677f"><td class="cell-title"><a href="Private%20duplicate%20of%20database%208fc3aa72bde64525906231f8da6c51d5/A%20Verifiable%20Credentials%20System%20with%20Privacy-Prese%20b4f3c3de2c9e4f6f80b7ab952cd2677f.html">A Verifiable Credentials System with Privacy-Preserving Based on Blockchain</a></td><td class="cell-Zv|V"><a href="https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation.aspx?paperid=115526">https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation.aspx?paperid=115526</a></td><td class="cell-XOyH"><span class="selected-value select-value-color-orange">Maybe relevant</span></td><td class="cell-L`&lt;d">2022</td><td class="cell-Xh&gt;J">Decentralized identity authentication is generally based on blockchain, with the protection of user privacy as the core appeal. But traditional decentralized credential system requires users to show all the information of the entire credential to the verifier, resulting in unnecessary overexposure of personal information. From the perspective of user privacy, this paper proposed a verifiable credential scheme with selective disclosure based on BLS (Bohen- Lynn-Shacham) aggregate signature. Instead of signing the credentials, we sign the claims in the credentials. When the user needs to present the credential to verifier, the user can select a part of but not all claims to be presented. To reduce the number of signatures of claims after selective disclosure, BLS aggregate signature is achieved to aggregate signatures of claims into one signature. In addition, our scheme also supports the aggregation of credentials from different users. As a result, verifier only needs to verify one signature in the credential to achieve the purpose of batch verification of credentials. We analyze the security of our aggregate signature scheme, which can effectively resist aggregate signature forgery attack and credential theft attack. The simulation results show that our selective disclosure scheme based on BLS aggregate signature is acceptable in terms of verification efficiency, and can reduce the storage cost and communication overhead. As a result, our scheme is suitable for blockchain, which is strict on bandwidth and storage overhead.</td><td class="cell-?txd"><span class="selected-value select-value-color-blue">Anonymous Credentials</span><span class="selected-value select-value-color-green">VC</span></td><td class="cell-@i@U"><span class="selected-value select-value-color-yellow">Anonymous Credentials</span><span class="selected-value select-value-color-pink">Verifiable Credentials</span></td><td class="cell-G:qo">no idea</td><td class="cell-&lt;V&gt;{"></td></tr><tr id="6ca56848-c73a-4a3a-821c-82813af6241d"><td class="cell-title"><a href="Private%20duplicate%20of%20database%208fc3aa72bde64525906231f8da6c51d5/Hyperledger%20Indy%206ca56848c73a4a3a821c82813af6241d.html">Hyperledger Indy</a></td><td class="cell-Zv|V"><a href="https://indy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">https://indy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/</a></td><td class="cell-XOyH"></td><td class="cell-L`&lt;d"></td><td class="cell-Xh&gt;J"><a href="https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/indy/Hyperledger+Indy">Hyperledger Indy</a> provides tools, libraries, and reusable components for providing digital identities that are rooted in blockchains or other distributed ledgers so they are interoperable across administrative domains, applications, and any silo.

Many standards-making bodies, open source working groups, organizations, and individuals are working on self-sovereign identity (SSI) and decentralized verifiable credentials. Commonly suggested principles include identity binding, privacy and security, user control, availability to all, interoperability across platforms, user consent, data minimization, and transparency about data creation, collection, storage, and use. Solutions will likely make use of consensus-driven, international standards in distributed technologies like smart wallets, blockchains, utility tokens, and decentralized identifiers (DIDs). To achieve this vision, the roles of issuers, holders, and verifiers—known as the “trust triangle”—must be incentivized to adopt the solution. We provide examples of two early solutions for verifiable credentials: SmartResume and digital health passes (DHPs). iDatafy’s SmartResume is a job market platform that creates digital resumes based on verifiable credentials and secures these credentials on a blockchain. Digital health passes (DHPs) prove our health to verifiers so we can return to travel, work, school, and play. We assess the degree to which these solutions subscribe to the suggested principles of verifiable credentials and describe how participants are incentivized to join the ecosystem. We found that these first-generation solutions meet some, but not yet all, of the suggested principles for fully decentralized verifiable credentials. The early solutions are “minimal viable products” that will likely improve in the future based on feedback and experimentation. Trusted third parties are still needed for services, and interoperability standards, user-generated identifiers, utility tokens are not yet advanced enough for wide-scale adoptions of SSI and verifiable credentials, but we can more easily see the possibilities.</td><td class="cell-?txd"><span class="selected-value select-value-color-green">VC</span></td><td class="cell-@i@U"><span class="selected-value select-value-color-red">Critique</span></td><td class="cell-G:qo">no idea</td><td class="cell-&lt;V&gt;{"></td></tr><tr id="5fb8b5d4-dc4f-4aad-8208-0293a21cb5a5"><td class="cell-title"><a href="Private%20duplicate%20of%20database%208fc3aa72bde64525906231f8da6c51d5/Who%20Watches%20the%20Watchmen%20A%20Review%20of%20Subjective%20Ap%205fb8b5d4dc4f4aad82080293a21cb5a5.html">Who Watches the Watchmen?

Lacking protocols in place to account for subjectivity, these systems do not form new sources of legitimacy that can address the central question concerning identity authentication: “Who verifies the verifier?” The legitimacy of claims is instead derived from traditional centralized institutions such as national ID issuers and KYC providers. This architecture has been employed, in part, to safeguard protocols from a vulnerability previously thought to be impossible to address in peer-to-peer identity systems: the Sybil attack, which refers to the abuse of a digital network by creating many illegitimate virtual personas. Inspired by the progress in cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, there has recently been a surge in networked protocols that make use of subjective inputs such as voting, vouching, and interpreting to arrive at a decentralized and Sybil-resistant consensus for identity. In doing so, these projects illustrate that the best technologies do not abstract away subjectivity but instead embrace it as a necessity and strength. In this review, we will outline the approaches of these new and natively digital sources of authentication—their attributes, methodologies, strengths, and weaknesses—and sketch out possible directions for future developments.</td><td class="cell-?txd"></td><td class="cell-@i@U"><span class="selected-value select-value-color-red">Good reference source</span><span class="selected-value select-value-color-blue">Worthwile Sybil resistance insights</span></td><td class="cell-G:qo">no idea</td><td class="cell-&lt;V&gt;{"></td></tr><tr id="9f7ad72a-04d9-4539-9cc9-688ddb1dc09f"><td class="cell-title"><a href="Private%20duplicate%20of%20database%208fc3aa72bde64525906231f8da6c51d5/A%20Decentralized%20Public%20Key%20Infrastructure%20with%20Ide%209f7ad72a04d945399cc9688ddb1dc09f.html">A Decentralized Public Key Infrastructure with Identity Retention</a></td><td class="cell-Zv|V"><a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2014/803">https://eprint.iacr.org/2014/803</a></td><td class="cell-XOyH"><span class="selected-value select-value-color-orange">Maybe relevant</span></td><td class="cell-L`&lt;d">2014</td><td class="cell-Xh&gt;J">Public key infrastructures (PKIs) enable users to look up and verify one another&#x27;s public keys based on identities.

communication between individuals, services and devices
through centralized digital entities presents considerable risks.
Service providers collect and store information that is used
for data mining, profiling and exploitation without users&#x27;
knowledge or consent. Having service providers continue to
offer their centric solutions is inefficient in terms of
duplication, has serious security lacunae and is cumbersome
to the users. The Self-sovereign Identity (SSI) concept, which
includes the individual&#x27;s consolidated digital identity and
verified attributes, enables the users of data to exert their
ownership and gain insights from their data’s usage. The
authentication and verification of digital identity is essential
to achieve the privacy and security of distributed digital
identities. However, the current literature still lacks the
comprehensive study on components of identity management
as well as user privacy and data protection mechanisms in
identity management architecture. In this paper, we provide a
coherent view of the central concepts of SSI, including the
components of identity proofing and authentication solutions
for different SSI solutions. Firstly, we discussed an overview
of Identity management approaches, introducing an
architecture overview as well as the relevant actors in such a
system and blockchain technology as solution for distributed
user-centric identity. Then we analyzed the authentication
and verification mechanisms in the context of digital identity.
Finally, we discuss the existing solutions and point out the
research gaps and elaborate challenges and trade-offs towards
building a complete identity management system (IdMs).</td><td class="cell-?txd"><span class="selected-value select-value-color-orange">DI</span><span class="selected-value select-value-color-gray">Data to Web3</span><span class="selected-value select-value-color-green">VC</span></td><td class="cell-@i@U"><span class="selected-value select-value-color-purple">Data to Web3</span><span class="selected-value select-value-color-yellow">Decentralized identity</span><span class="selected-value select-value-color-gray">Self-sovereign identity</span><span class="selected-value select-value-color-pink">Verifiable Credentials</span></td><td class="cell-G:qo">no idea</td><td class="cell-&lt;V&gt;{"></td></tr><tr id="3b040207-8c28-4da5-81e9-9b021309b67f"><td class="cell-title"><a href="Private%20duplicate%20of%20database%208fc3aa72bde64525906231f8da6c51d5/Decentralized%20Identity%20on%20Tezos%203b0402078c284da581e99b021309b67f.html">Decentralized Identity on Tezos</a></td><td class="cell-Zv|V"><a href="https://did-tezos.spruceid.com/">https://did-tezos.spruceid.com/</a></td><td class="cell-XOyH"><span class="selected-value select-value-color-orange">Maybe relevant</span></td><td class="cell-L`&lt;d"></td><td class="cell-Xh&gt;J">Tezos is an open-source blockchain protocol that has a formalized process for upgrades and uses a virtual machine language called Michelson, which is designed to support formal verification using proof assistants.

Using an append-only distributed ledger such as Bitcoin&#x27;s blockchain, we show how participants can make anonymous yet verifiable assertions about their own reputation. In particular, reputation can be demonstrated and updated effectively using efficient zkSNARK proofs. The system maintains soundness, peer-pseudonym unlinkability as well as unlinkability among pseudonyms of the same peer. We formally prove these properties and we evaluate the efficiency of the various operations, demonstrating the viability of our approach.</td><td class="cell-?txd"><span class="selected-value select-value-color-orange">DI</span></td><td class="cell-@i@U"></td><td class="cell-G:qo">no idea</td><td class="cell-&lt;V&gt;{"></td></tr><tr id="ff55af5b-6b3f-4dcc-8486-124c927a242f"><td class="cell-title"><a href="Private%20duplicate%20of%20database%208fc3aa72bde64525906231f8da6c51d5/EIDAS%20SUPPORTED%20SELF-SOVEREIGN%20IDENTITY%20ff55af5b6b3f4dcc8486124c927a242f.html">EIDAS SUPPORTED SELF-SOVEREIGN IDENTITY</a></td><td class="cell-Zv|V"><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/system/files/ged/eidas_supported_ssi_may_2019_0.pdf">https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/system/files/ged/eidas_supported_ssi_may_2019_0.pdf</a></td><td class="cell-XOyH"><span class="selected-value select-value-color-yellow">Relevant</span></td><td class="cell-L`&lt;d">2019</td><td class="cell-Xh&gt;J">The purpose of this document is to stimulate the discussion on how identity management solutions based on the Decentralised Identity / Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) paradigms can benefit from the trust framework created by the eIDAS Regulation.</td><td class="cell-?txd"><span class="selected-value select-value-color-orange">DI</span><span class="selected-value select-value-color-green">VC</span></td><td class="cell-@i@U"></td><td class="cell-G:qo">no idea</td><td class="cell-&lt;V&gt;{"></td></tr><tr id="809b9e8e-3f11-403c-990c-d197b04fbaf2"><td class="cell-title"><a href="Private%20duplicate%20of%20database%208fc3aa72bde64525906231f8da6c51d5/Moralis%20809b9e8e3f11403c990cd197b04fbaf2.html">Moralis</a></td><td class="cell-Zv|V"><a href="https://moralis.io/">https://moralis.io/</a></td><td class="cell-XOyH"><span class="selected-value select-value-color-red">Not relevant</span></td><td class="cell-L`&lt;d"></td><td class="cell-Xh&gt;J">The Web3 authentication API is one of the tools allowing Moralis to bridge the gap between Web2 and Web3 development.</td><td class="cell-?txd"><span class="selected-value select-value-color-gray">Data to Web3</span></td><td class="cell-@i@U"></td><td class="cell-G:qo">no idea</td><td class="cell-&lt;V&gt;{"></td></tr><tr id="3a3b7acb-8f41-4f95-b52b-5b4db00fa29f"><td class="cell-title"><a href="Private%20duplicate%20of%20database%208fc3aa72bde64525906231f8da6c51d5/Sismo%203a3b7acb8f414f95b52b5b4db00fa29f.html">Sismo</a></td><td class="cell-Zv|V"><a href="https://www.sismo.io/">https://www.sismo.io/</a></td><td class="cell-XOyH"><span class="selected-value select-value-color-green">Very relevant</span></td><td class="cell-L`&lt;d"></td><td class="cell-Xh&gt;J">Sismo is a modular protocol issuing ZK Badges for reputation portability and aggregation. </td><td class="cell-?txd"><span class="selected-value select-value-color-orange">DI</span><span class="selected-value select-value-color-green">VC</span></td><td class="cell-@i@U"><span class="selected-value select-value-color-gray">Centralized/permissioned</span><span class="selected-value select-value-color-default">Implementations</span><span class="selected-value select-value-color-purple">Possible tool in larger solution</span></td><td class="cell-G:qo">no idea</td><td class="cell-&lt;V&gt;{"></td></tr><tr id="1d4f495d-eb40-435c-a630-afb7095204fb"><td class="cell-title"><a href="Private%20duplicate%20of%20database%208fc3aa72bde64525906231f8da6c51d5/Sora%20Identity%20Secure,%20Digital%20Identity%20on%20the%20Bloc%201d4f495deb40435ca630afb7095204fb.html">Sora Identity: Secure, Digital Identity on the Blockchain</a></td><td class="cell-Zv|V"><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8377927">https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8377927</a></td><td class="cell-XOyH"><span class="selected-value select-value-color-yellow">Relevant</span></td><td class="cell-L`&lt;d">2018</td><td class="cell-Xh&gt;J">Digital identity is the cornerstone of a digital economy. However, proving identity remotely is difficult to do. To complicate things further, identity is usually not a global, absolute construct, but the information shared with different parties differs, based on the relationship to the user. Therefore, a viable solution for digital identity should enable users to have full control over their personal information and share only the information that they wish to share with each service. Blockchain technology can help to realize a self-sovereign identity that puts the user in control of her information, by enabling a decentralized way to handle public key infrastructure. In the current contribution, we present the Sora identity system, which is a mobile app that utilizes blockchain technology to create a secure protocol for storing encrypted personal information, as well as sharing verifiable claims about personal information.</td><td class="cell-?txd"><span class="selected-value select-value-color-orange">DI</span><span class="selected-value select-value-color-green">VC</span></td><td class="cell-@i@U"></td><td class="cell-G:qo">no idea</td><td class="cell-&lt;V&gt;{"></td></tr><tr id="cf97169d-e0d9-4a81-ace7-c9a82243d1cd"><td class="cell-title"><a href="Private%20duplicate%20of%20database%208fc3aa72bde64525906231f8da6c51d5/The%20Sybil%20Attack%20cf97169de0d94a81ace7c9a82243d1cd.html">The Sybil Attack</a></td><td class="cell-Zv|V"><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2002/01/IPTPS2002.pdf">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2002/01/IPTPS2002.pdf</a></td><td class="cell-XOyH"><span class="selected-value select-value-color-green">Very relevant</span></td><td class="cell-L`&lt;d">2002</td><td class="cell-Xh&gt;J">Large-scale peer-to-peer systems face
security threats from faulty or hostile remote
computing elements. To resist these threats, many
such systems employ redundancy. However, if a
single faulty entity can present multiple identities,
it can control a substantial fraction of the system,
thereby undermining this redundancy. One
approach to preventing these “Sybil attacks” is to
have a trusted agency certify identities. This
paper shows that, without a logically centralized
authority, Sybil attacks are always possible except
under extreme and unrealistic assumptions of
resource parity and coordination among entities.</td><td class="cell-?txd"><span class="selected-value select-value-color-brown">Classic reference</span><span class="selected-value select-value-color-orange">DI</span><span class="selected-value select-value-color-red">Sybil resistance</span></td><td class="cell-@i@U"><span class="selected-value select-value-color-pink">Classic reference</span><span class="selected-value select-value-color-blue">Worthwile Sybil resistance insights</span></td><td class="cell-G:qo">no idea</td><td class="cell-&lt;V&gt;{"></td></tr><tr id="19a3dc16-5c29-496a-ba88-01b0e6f4aa13"><td class="cell-title"><a href="Private%20duplicate%20of%20database%208fc3aa72bde64525906231f8da6c51d5/Towards%20a%20standardized%20model%20for%20privacy-preservin%2019a3dc165c29496aba8801b0e6f4aa13.html">Towards a standardized model for privacy-preserving Verifiable Credentials</a></td><td class="cell-Zv|V"><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3465481.3469204">https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3465481.3469204</a></td><td class="cell-XOyH"><span class="selected-value select-value-color-yellow">Relevant</span></td><td class="cell-L`&lt;d">2021</td><td class="cell-Xh&gt;J">Lack of standardization and the subsequent difficulty of integration has been one of the main reasons for the scarce adoption of privacy-preserving Attribute-Based Credentials (p-ABC). Integration with the W3C’s Verifiable Credentials (VC) specification would help by encouraging homogenization between different p-ABC schemes and bringing them all closer to other digital credentials. What is more, p-ABCs can help to solve privacy issues that have been identified in applications of VCs to use cases like vaccination passports. However, there has not been much work focusing on the collaboration between p-ABCs and VCs. We address this topic by establishing initial steps for extra standardization of elements that will help with the integration of p-ABCs into the standard. Namely, we propose a data model for predicates, which are a staple of p-ABC systems, and tools and guidelines to ease the adaptation process like a validation meta-schema. These ideas have been applied in a proof-of-concept implementation of the OLYMPUS distributed p-ABC scheme paired with serialization following the VC data model.</td><td class="cell-?txd"><span class="selected-value select-value-color-green">VC</span></td><td class="cell-@i@U"></td><td class="cell-G:qo">no idea</td><td class="cell-&lt;V&gt;{"></td></tr><tr id="eaafa5e4-964f-4a75-916e-89df27930f47"><td class="cell-title"><a href="Private%20duplicate%20of%20database%208fc3aa72bde64525906231f8da6c51d5/Verida%20eaafa5e4964f4a75916e89df27930f47.html">Verida</a></td><td class="cell-Zv|V"><a href="https://docsend.com/view/hqd8d55nbucz83yf">https://docsend.com/view/hqd8d55nbucz83yf</a></td><td class="cell-XOyH"><span class="selected-value select-value-color-orange">Maybe relevant</span></td><td class="cell-L`&lt;d">2022</td><td class="cell-Xh&gt;J">Verida is a network of decentralized identity, data storage, messaging, and single sign-on solutions enabling interoperable ownership of personal data for Web3.

Yet many core economic activities—such as uncollateralized lending and building personal brands—are built on persistent, non-transferable relationships. In this paper, we illustrate how non-transferable “soulbound” tokens (SBTs) representing the commitments, credentials, and affiliations of “Souls” can encode the trust networks of the real economy to establish provenance and reputation. More importantly, SBTs enable other applications of increasing ambition, such as community wallet recovery, sybil-resistant governance, mechanisms for decentralization, and novel markets with decomposable, shared rights. We call this richer, pluralistic ecosystem “Decentralized Society” (DeSoc)—a co-determined sociality, where Souls and communities come together bottom-up, as emergent properties of each other to co-create plural network goods and intelligences, at a range of scales. Key to this sociality is decomposable property rights and enhanced governance mechanisms—such as quadratic funding discounted by correlation scores—that reward trust and cooperation while protecting networks from capture, extraction, and domination. With such augmented sociality, web3 can eschew today’s hyper-financialization in favor of a more transformative, pluralist future of increasing returns across social distance.</td><td class="cell-?txd"><span class="selected-value select-value-color-orange">DI</span></td><td class="cell-@i@U"></td><td class="cell-G:qo">no idea</td><td class="cell-&lt;V&gt;{"></td></tr><tr id="56506209-663f-43a1-8c73-bd4a136b1ea9"><td class="cell-title"><a href="Private%20duplicate%20of%20database%208fc3aa72bde64525906231f8da6c51d5/ERC725%20alliance%2056506209663f43a18c73bd4a136b1ea9.html">ERC725 alliance</a></td><td class="cell-Zv|V"><a href="https://erc725alliance.org/">https://erc725alliance.org/</a></td><td class="cell-XOyH"></td><td class="cell-L`&lt;d"></td><td class="cell-Xh&gt;J"></td><td class="cell-?txd"></td><td class="cell-@i@U"></td><td class="cell-G:qo">no idea</td><td class="cell-&lt;V&gt;{"></td></tr><tr id="fe645ea0-c67d-4b4c-9deb-e1ac4be1f47d"><td class="cell-title"><a href="Private%20duplicate%20of%20database%208fc3aa72bde64525906231f8da6c51d5/Improved%20Identity%20Management%20with%20Verifiable%20Crede%20fe645ea0c67d4b4c9debe1ac4be1f47d.html">Improved Identity Management with Verifiable Credentials and FIDO</a></td><td class="cell-Zv|V"><a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02950805/document">https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02950805/document</a></td><td class="cell-XOyH"><span class="selected-value select-value-color-orange">Maybe relevant</span></td><td class="cell-L`&lt;d">2019</td><td class="cell-Xh&gt;J">We describe how FIDO and W3C VCs can overcome the problems of existing identity management systems.

Their key envisioned uses (e.g. financial instruments) require them to consume data from outside the blockchain (e.g. stock quotes). Trustworthy data feeds that support a broad range of data requests will thus be critical to smart contract ecosystems.
We present an authenticated data feed system called Town Crier (TC). TC acts as a bridge between smart contracts and existing web sites, which are already commonly trusted for non-blockchain applications. It combines a blockchain front end with a trusted hardware back end to scrape HTTPS-enabled websites and serve source-authenticated data to relying smart contracts. 
TC also supports confidentiality. It enables private data requests with encrypted parameters. Additionally, in a generalization that executes smart-contract logic within TC, the system permits secure use of user credentials to scrape access-controlled online data sources. 
We describe TC’s design principles and architecture and report on an implementation that uses Intel’s recently introduced Software Guard Extensions (SGX) to furnish data to the Ethereum smart contract system. We formally model TC and define and prove its basic security properties in the Universal Composability (UC) framework. Our results include definitions and techniques of general interest relating to resource consumption (Ethereum’s “gas” fee system) and TCB minimization. We also report on experiments with three example applications.
