national identity cards and/or ePassports; eSIM) is introduced here to
permissionless blockchains in order to remove the inefficiencies of Sybil-
resistant mechanisms such as Proof-of-Work (i.e., high energy and en-
vironmental costs) and Proof-of-Stake (i.e., capital hoarding and lower
transaction volume). The proposed solution effectively limits the number
of mining nodes a single individual would be able to run while keeping
membership open to everyone, circumventing the impossibility of full de-
centralization and the blockchain scalability trilemma when instantiated
on a blockchain with a consensus protocol based on the cryptographic
random selection of nodes. Resistance to collusion is also considered.
Solving one of the most pressing problems in blockchains, a zk-PoI
cryptocurrency is proved to have the following advantageous properties:
- an incentive-compatible protocol for the issuing of cryptocurrency
rewards based on a unique Nash equilibrium
- strict domination of mining over all other PoW/PoS cryptocurrencies,
thus the zk-PoI cryptocurrency becoming the preferred choice by miners
is proved to be a Nash equilibrium and the Evolutionarily Stable Strategy
- PoW/PoS cryptocurrencies are condemned to pay the Price of Crypto-
Anarchy, redeemed by the optimal efficiency of zk-PoI as it implements
the social optimum
- the circulation of a zk-PoI cryptocurrency Pareto dominates other
PoW/PoS cryptocurrencies
- the network effects arising from the social networks inherent to na-
tional identity cards and ePassports dominate PoW/PoS cryptocurrencies
- the lower costs of its infrastructure imply the existence of a unique
equilibrium where it dominates other forms of payment"

With all three schemes, the user can arbitrarily choose a portion of his access rights to prove possession of credentials while the number of expensive cryptographic computations spent is independent of the number of accessx rights being chosen. Moreover, the third anonymous credential scheme is not only fast batch verifiable but also fast fine-grained revocable, which means that to verify whether an arbitrarily chosen subset of credentials is revoked entails constant computation cost."

The construction we propose is efficient: it requires just a few exponentiations in a prime-order group in which the decisional Diffie-Hellman problem is hard. Thus, for the first time, we give a provably secure construction of anonymous credentials that can work in the elliptic group setting without bilinear pairings and is based on the DDH assumption. In contrast, prior provably secure constructions were based on the RSA group or on groups with pairings, which made them prohibitively inefficient for mobile devices, RFIDs and smartcards. The only prior efficient construction that could work in such elliptic curve groups, due to Brands, does not have a proof of security."

Revocation is critical to the security of such systems. We construct a short group signature scheme that supports Verifier-Local Revocation (VLR). In this model, revocation messages are only sent to signature verifiers (as opposed to both signers and verifiers). Consequently there is no need to contact individual signers when some user is revoked. This model is appealing for systems providing attestation capabilities. Our signatures are as short as standard RSA signatures with comparable security. Security of our group signature (in the random oracle model) is based on the Strong Diffie-Hellman assumption and the Decision Linear assumption in bilinear groups.

These acclaimed proofs, however, are either trivial to falsify or require trust in centralized entities (e.g., search engine caches). This motivates the need for a seamless and standardized internet-wide non-repudiation mechanism, allowing users to share data from news sources, social websites or financial data feeds in a provably secure manner. Additionally, blockchain oracles that enable data-rich smart contracts typically rely on a trusted third party (e.g., TLSNotary or Intel SGX). A decentralized method to transfer webbased content into a permissionless blockchain without additional trusted third party would allow for smart contract applications to flourish. In this work, we present TLS-N, the first TLS extension that provides secure non-repudiation and solves both of the mentioned challenges. TLS-N generates non-interactive proofs about the content of a TLS session that can be efficiently verified by third parties and blockchain based smart contracts. As such, TLS-N increases the accountability for content provided on the web and enables a practical and decentralized blockchain oracle for web content. TLS-N is compatible with TLS 1.3 and adds a minor overhead to a typical TLS session. When a proof is generated, parts of the TLS session (e.g., passwords, cookies) can be hidden for privacy reasons, while the remaining content can be verified."

Although the debate about the medical and ethical problems of immunity passports has been widespread, there has been less inspection of the technical foundations of immunity passport schemes. These schemes are envisaged to be used for sharing COVID-19 test and vaccination results in general. The most prominent immunity passport schemes have involved a stack of little-known standards, such as Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs) from the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Our analysis shows that this group of technical identity standards are based on under-specified and often non-standardized documents that have substantial security and privacy issues, due in part to the questionable use of blockchain technology. One concrete proposal for immunity passports is even susceptible to dictionary attacks. The use of cryptography theater' in efforts like immunity passports, where cryptography is used to allay the privacy concerns of users, should be discouraged in standardization. Deployment of these W3C standards for `self-sovereign identity' in use-cases like immunity passports could just as well lead to a dangerous form identity totalitarianism."

Anonymous credentials were developed to address these concerns. However, existing schemes do not handle the realities of deployment or the complexities of real world identity. Instead, they make (often incorrect) assumptions, e.g., that the local department of motor vehicles will issue sophisticated cryptographic tokens to show users are over 18. In reality, there are multiple trust sources for a given identity attribute, their credentials have distinctively different formats, and many, if not all, issuers are unwilling to adopt new protocols. We present and build zk-creds, a protocol that uses general-purpose zero-knowledge proofs to 1) remove the need for credential issuers to hold signing keys: credentials can be issued via a transparency log, Byzantine system, or even a blockchain; 2) convert existing identity documents into anonymous credentials without modifying documents or coordinating with their issuing authority; 3) allow for flexible, composable, and complex identity statements over multiple credentials. Concretely, identity assertions using zk-creds take less than 300ms in a real-world scenario of using a passport to anonymously access age-restricted videos."

Given their opinions, and weighted by their expertise level, a single update is then implemented and evaluated, and the experts receive rewards based on their choices. We show that this mechanism always has approximate pure Nash equilibria and that these achieve a constant factor approximation with respect to the quality benchmark of the optimal alternative. Finally, we study the repeated version of the problem, where the weights of the experts are adjusted after each update, according to their performance. Under mild assumptions about the weights, the extension of our mechanism still has approximate pure Nash equilibria in this setting.''

These solutions take two main directions: either securely store the secret and implement an access control mechanism, or divide the secret into a set of shares and distribute them in different machines (such as the Shamir’s secret sharing approach or multi-party computation MPC). However, apart from the MPC approach, they all share the same limitation: once the consumer receives the secret, it can be leaked and be used by any malicious actor. We believe that the secret management should not be centralised and that the secret should never be sent to the receiver. Therefore, in this paper we propose, Secretation, a new approach for managing the secrets in a decentralised way by leveraging decentralised identity concepts such as verifiable credential technologies, password-authenticated key exchange protocols and multi-party computation.

This paper seeks to identify possible fields of application and to compare both approaches with respect to the credentials’ non-transferability.
The paper shows that both approaches do not ensure the non- transferability of anonymous credentials, but may be applicable in some fields. On the one hand, it might be hard to find valuable secrets to really prevent the sharing of credentials, in particular with close family members. On the other hand, biometric sensors embedded in a smartcard can be circumvented with some effort, especially if access control is unattended. Although the combination of both approaches may prevent more users from sharing their credentials, it suffers from restrictions of both approaches and from the effort needed to put it in place.
However, assuming that anonymous credentials will probably not be used in high-security environments, both approaches might be sufficient to prevent sharing in some applications. If the users already possess personal digital assistants, embedded valuable secrets are a quite cheap solution, even though they raise the system’s value. If access control is attended, biometric sensors are reasonably safe and limit the possibility of unintentionally sharing the credentials for free."

(2) To prevent misuse of anonymity, our scheme is the first to offer optional anonymity revocation for particular transactions. (3) Our scheme offers separability: all organizations can choose their cryptographic keys independently of each other. Moreover, we suggest more effective means of preventing users from sharing their credentials, by introducing all-or-nothing

At the same time, it is infeasible to find a witness for a value that was not accumulated. We put forward the notion of a dynamic accumulator, which is an accumulator that allows one to dynamically add and delete inputs, such that the cost of an add or delete is independent of the number of accumulated values. We achieve this under the strong RSA assumption. For this construction, we also show an efficient zero-knowledge protocol for proving that a committed value is in the accumulator. Dynamic accumulators enable efficient membership revocation in the anonymous setting. Our construction is especially suitable for membership revocation in group signature and identity escrow schemes, such as the one due to Ateniese et al. [ACJT00], and efficient revocation of credentials in anonymous credential systems, such as the one due to Camenisch and Lysyanskaya [CL01a]. Applying our method to these schemes enables membership revocation and yet does not significantly increase the complexity of any of the operations. In particular, the cost of a membership verification or credential
showing increases by only a small constant factor, less than 2. All previously known methods (such as the ones due to Bresson and Stern [BS01] and Ateniese and Tsudik [AT01]) incur an increase in these costs that is linear in the number of members."

The second vein in the literature considers defending against the attack by testing resources, which can
be in the form of IP testing, network coordinates, or recurring cost (e.g., by requiring clients to solve puzzles). The third and last vein in the literature is by mitigating the attack, combining social

However, the excessive pursuit of self-sovereignty in the most existing SSI schemes hinders sanctions against attackers. To deal with the malicious behavior, a few SSI schemes introduce accountability mechanisms, but they sacrifice users’ privacy. In addition, the digital identities (static strings or updatable chains) in the existing SSI schemes are as inputs to a third-party executable program (mobile app, smart contract, etc.) to achieve identity reading, storing and proving, and users’ self-sovereignty are weakened. To solve the above problems, we present a new self-sovereign identity scheme to strike a balance between privacy and accountability and get rid of the dependence on the third-party program. In our scheme, one and only individual-specific executable code is generated as a digital avatar-i for each human to interact with others in cyberspace without a third-party program, in which the embedding of biometrics enhances uniqueness and user control over their identity. In addition, a joint accountability mechanism, which is based on the shamir (t, n) threshold algorithm and a consortium blockchain, is designed to restrict the power of each regulatory authority and protect users’ privacy. Finally, we analyze the security, SSI properties and conduct detailed experiments in terms of the cost of computation, storage, and blockchain gas. The analysis results indicate that our scheme resists the known attacks and fulfills all the six SSI properties. Compared with the state-of-the-art schemes, the extensive experiment results show that the cost is larger in server storage, blockchain storage, and blockchain gas, but is still low enough for practical situations."

Using such a public ledger and standard cryptographic primitives, we propose and provide a proof of security for a basic anonymous credential system that allows users to make flexible identity assertions with strong privacy guarantees without relying on trusted parties.

Recent works have leveraged social network-based trust relationships to defend against Sybil attacks. However, existing defenses are based on oversimplified assumptions about network structure, which do not necessarily hold in real-world social networks. Recognizing these limitations, we propose SYBILFUSE, a defense-in-depth framework for Sybil detection when the oversimplified assumptions are relaxed. SYBILFUSE adopts a collective classification approach by first training local classifiers to compute local trust scores for nodes and edges, and then propagating the local scores through the global network structure via weighted random walk and loopy belief propagation mechanisms. We evaluate our framework on both synthetic and real-world network topologies, including a large-scale, labeled Twitter network comprising 20M nodes and 265M edges, and demonstrate that SYBILFUSE outperforms state-of-the-art approaches significantly. In particular, SYBILFUSE achieves 98% of Sybil coverage among top-ranked nodes."

Furthermore, the voters receive a reward only when they agree with the majority outcome, a tactic that may lead to herd behavior. This paper proposes an oracle protocol based on peer prediction mechanisms with non-linear staking rules. In the proposed approach, instead of being rewarded when agreeing with a majority outcome, a voter receives awards when their report achieves a relatively high score based on a peer prediction scoring scheme.

Recently, a self-sovereign identity model has been researched actively as an alternative to the existing identity models such as a centralized identity model, federated identity model, and user-centric model.  The self-sovereign identity model allows a user to have complete control of his identity. Meanwhile, the core component of the self-sovereign identity model is data minimization. The data minimization signifies that the extent of the exposure of user private identity should be minimized. As a solution to data minimization, zero-knowledge proofs can be grafted to the self-sovereign identity model. Specifically, zero-knowledge Succinct Non-interactive ARgument of Knowledges(zk-SNARKs) enables proving the truth of the statement on an arbitrary relation. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving self-sovereign identity model based on zkSNARKs to allow any type of data minimization beyond the selective disclosure and range proof. The security of proposed model is formally proven under the security of the zero-knowledge proof and the unforgeability of the signature in the random oracle model. Furthermore, we optimize the proving time by checking the correctness of the commitment outside of the proof relation for practical use. The resulting scheme improves proving time for hash computation (to verify a commitment input) from 0.5 s to about 0.1 ms on a 32-bit input."

Additionally, we demonstrate how trees from multiple sources can be combined together by modifying the tree structure. This allows claims by different authorities, such as an employer or professional organization, to be combined under a single certificate, without the CA needing to know (or to verify) all of the claims. In addition to describing the hash tree structure and protocols for constructing and verifying our proposed credential, we formally prove that it provides unforgeability and privacy and we present performance results demonstrating its efficiency.

We have implemented a prototype client-server system, deployed the prototype in Emulab, and evaluated the server-side throughput for attribute-based identity verification.

But traditional decentralized credential system requires users to show all the information of the entire credential to the verifier, resulting in unnecessary overexposure of personal information. From the perspective of user privacy, this paper proposed a verifiable credential scheme with selective disclosure based on BLS (Bohen- Lynn-Shacham) aggregate signature. Instead of signing the credentials, we sign the claims in the credentials. When the user needs to present the credential to verifier, the user can select a part of but not all claims to be presented. To reduce the number of signatures of claims after selective disclosure, BLS aggregate signature is achieved to aggregate signatures of claims into one signature. In addition, our scheme also supports the aggregation of credentials from different users. As a result, verifier only needs to verify one signature in the credential to achieve the purpose of batch verification of credentials. We analyze the security of our aggregate signature scheme, which can effectively resist aggregate signature forgery attack and credential theft attack. The simulation results show that our selective disclosure scheme based on BLS aggregate signature is acceptable in terms of verification efficiency, and can reduce the storage cost and communication overhead. As a result, our scheme is suitable for blockchain, which is strict on bandwidth and storage overhead."

Many standards-making bodies, open source working groups, organizations, and individuals are working on self-sovereign identity (SSI) and decentralized verifiable credentials. Commonly suggested principles include identity binding, privacy and security, user control, availability to all, interoperability across platforms, user consent, data minimization, and transparency about data creation, collection, storage, and use. Solutions will likely make use of consensus-driven, international standards in distributed technologies like smart wallets, blockchains, utility tokens, and decentralized identifiers (DIDs). To achieve this vision, the roles of issuers, holders, and verifiers—known as the “trust triangle”—must be incentivized to adopt the solution. We provide examples of two early solutions for verifiable credentials: SmartResume and digital health passes (DHPs). iDatafy’s SmartResume is a job market platform that creates digital resumes based on verifiable credentials and secures these credentials on a blockchain. Digital health passes (DHPs) prove our health to verifiers so we can return to travel, work, school, and play. We assess the degree to which these solutions subscribe to the suggested principles of verifiable credentials and describe how participants are incentivized to join the ecosystem. We found that these first-generation solutions meet some, but not yet all, of the suggested principles for fully decentralized verifiable credentials. The early solutions are “minimal viable products” that will likely improve in the future based on feedback and experimentation. Trusted third parties are still needed for services, and interoperability standards, user-generated identifiers, utility tokens are not yet advanced enough for wide-scale adoptions of SSI and verifiable credentials, but we can more easily see the possibilities."

This architecture has been employed, in part, to safeguard protocols from a vulnerability previously thought to be impossible to address in peer-to-peer identity systems: the Sybil attack, which refers to the abuse of a digital network by creating many illegitimate virtual personas. Inspired by the progress in cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, there has recently been a surge in networked protocols that make use of subjective inputs such as voting, vouching, and interpreting to arrive at a decentralized and Sybil-resistant consensus for identity. In doing so, these projects illustrate that the best technologies do not abstract away subjectivity but instead embrace it as a necessity and strength.
