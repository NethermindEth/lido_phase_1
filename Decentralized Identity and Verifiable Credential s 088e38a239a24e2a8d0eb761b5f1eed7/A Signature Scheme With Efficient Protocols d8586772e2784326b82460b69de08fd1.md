Discusses, among others, that anonymous credentials can be constructed from signature and committment schemes, and some extra protocols. It is a derivative of Lysyanskayaâ€™s thesis, see [****Signature schemes and applications to cryptographic protocol design****](Signature%20schemes%20and%20applications%20to%20cryptographi%20ee1463d272494f37b9642bb47244a2f9.md)
