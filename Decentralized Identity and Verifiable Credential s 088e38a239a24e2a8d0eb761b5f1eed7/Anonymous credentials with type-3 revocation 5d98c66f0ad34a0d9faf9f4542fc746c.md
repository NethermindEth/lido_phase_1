This is mentioned in the paper :

[Towards Smart Contract-based Verification of Anonymous Credentials](Towards%20Smart%20Contract-based%20Verification%20of%20Anony%20e67bbeeb805044c3aadd44ad3d57795f.md)

They cite this as a solution that uses am approach to Sybil resistance that does not rely on the issuer checking that it never issues two credentials associated to the same attribute.

Note that it is in Hyperledgerâ€™s github.
