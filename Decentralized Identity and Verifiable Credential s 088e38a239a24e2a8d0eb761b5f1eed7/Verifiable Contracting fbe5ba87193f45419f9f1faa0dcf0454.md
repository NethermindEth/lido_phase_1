# Verifiable Contracting

Abstract: We investigate the combined use of eIDAS-based electronic identity and Verifiable Credentials for remote onboarding and contracting, and provide a proof-of-concept implementation based on SAML authentication. The main non-trivial value derived from this proposal is a higher degree of assurance in the contract offering phase for the Contracting Service Provider.

**Overview**

The paper proposes a system that allows contractors to verify the information provided by an applicant (such as an IBAN).

Their approach leverages W3Câ€™s VC recommendation, and the so-called eIDAS framework.

**Assessment**

The eIDAS framework relies on a trusted central party. Hence the paper is not relevant for us.
