# Unclonable group identification

Abstract: We introduce and motivate the concept of unclonable group identification,
that provides maximal protection against sharing of identities while still protecting the anonymity of users. We prove that the notion can be realized from any one-way function and suggest a more efficient implementation based on specific assumptions.
