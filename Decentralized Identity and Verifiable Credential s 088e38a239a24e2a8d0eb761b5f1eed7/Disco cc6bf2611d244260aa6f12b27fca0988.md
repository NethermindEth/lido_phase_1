An anonymous credential system, that doesn’t appear to be significantly different from the others that people have discussed.  It also appears to rely on their centralized server.

In addition to maintaining their own profile, users can issue credentials and award them to other users.

## Profiles

Profiles are attached to a wallet, which is ultimately an Ethereum address.

The profiles are stored on the Ceramic network, a Content Storage Network.

Disco let’s users link their profiles to their Twitter and Discord accounts, in addition to their Ethereum address and credentials issued by other users.

Credentials can be revocable, if they’re issued with a pointer to where to find the revocation list.
