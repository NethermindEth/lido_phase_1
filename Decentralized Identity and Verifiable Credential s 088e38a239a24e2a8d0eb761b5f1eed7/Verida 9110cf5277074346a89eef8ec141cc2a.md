# Verida

Abstract: Verida is a network of decentralized identity, data storage, messaging, and single sign-on solutions enabling interoperable ownership of personal data for Web3. User’s verified personal data can be bridged into smart contracts, enabling off-chain data connectivity to multiple blockchains.

# Introduction

- Vision: allowing users to own their data, and to take advantage of it in private.
- The current Web3 tech stack is not mature enough to compete with centralized solutions.

### Identity

- The Verida network incorporates a decentralized identity management framework that enables the creation of anonymous identities, that are *containers* for many different identities.
- It provides a consent model for sharing these identities, or proof of these identities, to other applications and account holders on the network.

### Web3 messaging infrastructure.

- Email has provided a critical role in the authentication layer of Web2 applications. Users typically supply an email address to login or reset their password via email.
- Need for a protocol facilitating consensual access to private data with third parties, in a way that works across multiple chains.

### Accessing off-chain data on-chain

Verida offers a bridge that connects signed on-chain data to on-chain smart contracts in a secure,
verifiable and privacy preserving way.

### Decentralized personal data storage

- Verida’s Storage Node provides “private encrypted databases, user control over where and how their data is stored, real-time synchronization, permissioned data access, and client-side encryption”
- Identity, authentication, authorization and encryption are anchored by a user’s private keys. The personal data itself is encrypted and stored on-chain, with tight authentication and access controls.

# Use cases

The ones that matter the most to us are:

- “The Verida API Connector Framework is designed to pull data from the most valuable centralized systems (Facebook, Google, Twitter, Github etc), filter and cleanse for fidelity, normalize the data into common schemas, and store it in the user’s personal data Vault. This serves as a way for users to ‘unlock’ their Web2 data and create personalized data-rich user identity profiles that they directly own and control.”
- Private and re-usable on-chain KYC credentials for compliance
- Rich on-chain identity and reputation profiles

Notes:

- Verida provides open-source server nodes that can be operated by anyone on their own infrastructure, to earn tokens on the Verida Network.
- Every account on the Verida network is a decentralized identity (DID). Users can easily maintain multiple Verida accounts for different purposes in one Verida Vault.
- “We’re actively researching the most appropriate blockchain solution for launching the first phase of the network. This blockchain must meet our specific needs around speed, scalability, and transaction costs.” Any update?

### More on API Connector Framework

This framework provides a library of tools to help developers build API connectors that pull data from centralized systems, normalize the data into common schemas, and store it in the user’s personal data Vault.

During the launch phase of the Verida network, developers can register their API connector and earn Verida token rewards from the Community Grants Rewards pool, once their implementation has been verified by the Verida core team.

What has been implemented so far? From an August 24th post:

> *Verida’s Web2 Data Bridges connect signed off-chain data to web3 apps in a verifiable and privacy preserving way. Currently data connectors for Facebook and Twitter have been developed, allowing users to claim their personal data and store it in the Verida Vault. This serves as a way for users to ‘unlock’ their off-chain data and create personalized user identity profiles that they own and control.*

It should be noted that there is no prominent mention of oracles, or of verifiably fetching data.

Note:

> *We could wait until all the pieces are ready or we can start building today, using a hybrid of centralized and decentralized, with a clear plan towards decentralization in the future. Verida takes the latter approach as a pragmatic way to push the technology forward as quickly as possible, while learning from real-world use cases. This also allows us to move through iterations much faster, developing centralized APIs that are then decentralized once their technical requirements become stable.*

# Verida Network

The network will allow service providers to run nodes that provide the aforementioned services.

Value is captured in the Verida Network through data sharing, messaging, data validation processes, and new market creation. There are many new markets already being explored by Verida partners that include; Hyper-personalized insurance oers with decentralized claim management, Patient owned healthcare data with data marketplaces for researchers.

Verida aims to grow its network through a two-pronged approach; with partnerships for enterprise solutions and partnerships with Web3 native ecosystems.

### Network functions

- DID registry
- Network interactions (e.g. messages). It’s initially proposed a Network Interaction will be equivalent to $US 0.05.
- Trust framework:
    - The Trust Framework brings enhanced trust to all off-chain and on-chain interactions facilitated by the Verida Network.
    - Entities can participate in the Trust Framework by providing proofs linking their entity details, social profiles, website, verified KYC or public blockchain key(s) so they can have trusted interactions with other users of the network.
    - Status: Currently under R&D.
- Verifiable credentials (live on testnet)

### Economic model:

![Untitled](Verida%209110cf5277074346a89eef8ec141cc2a/Untitled%206.png)

- Infrastructure providers must bond VDA tokens when providing services to the Verida network (such as Storage Nodes) to become discoverable across the network. These bonded tokens are held in the network and can be slashed if the infrastructure provider doesn’t meet agreed upon infrastructure metrics.
- Community Stakers deposit tokens in the Interactions Registry to secure the network.
- Verida will be governed by the Verida Foundation, with Verida Labs supporting the development of the protocol as early contributors. The core team are early custodians of the protocol and plan to transition to a decentralized governance model as the protocol and community matures.

Observe that the VDA token is not live yet.

# What else is live?

> *Significant engineering effort has gone towards our [Decentralized DID Registry](https://github.com/verida/blockchain-contracts/tree/develop/VDA-DID-Registry) that will be launched shortly on Testnet. This is a fork of [ethr-did-registry](https://github.com/uport-project/ethr-did-registry) with extensions that support “per application” based service endpoints, a built-in “proof” mechanism that unlocks the ability to create a generic “data bridge” to prove verified off-chain data on any Verida supported blockchain.*
