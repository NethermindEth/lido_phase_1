# A Survey on Non-transferable Anonymous Credentials

Abstract: There are at least two principal approaches to prevent users from sharing their anonymous credentials: adding valuable secrets into the system the user does not want to share or embedding biometric access control. This paper seeks to identify possible fields of application and to compare both approaches with respect to the credentialsâ€™ non-transferability.
The paper shows that both approaches do not ensure the non- transferability of anonymous credentials, but may be applicable in some fields. On the one hand, it might be hard to find valuable secrets to really prevent the sharing of credentials, in particular with close family members. On the other hand, biometric sensors embedded in a smartcard can be circumvented with some effort, especially if access control is unattended. Although the combination of both approaches may prevent more users from sharing their credentials, it suffers from restrictions of both approaches and from the effort needed to put it in place.
However, assuming that anonymous credentials will probably not be used in high-security environments, both approaches might be sufficient to prevent sharing in some applications. If the users already possess personal digital assistants, embedded valuable secrets are a quite cheap solution, even though they raise the systemâ€™s value. If access control is attended, biometric sensors are reasonably safe and limit the possibility of unintentionally sharing the credentials for free.

The paper makes a high-level discussion of how to prevent a user  from sharing its anonymous credential. The two main approaches are:

- Embedding a valuable secret into the credential, so that sharing the credential reveals the secret
- Using a biometric device

As said, the discussion is very high level and brief. 

Its conclusions are disappointing:  forgetting about biometrics (which we donâ€™t care about AFAIU), their conclusion about embedding secrets is that these donâ€™t prevent sharing the credential. The user may share it with friends, or may be willing to accept the sharinig of its secret.

Also, there are only 10 references (Iâ€™d expect more in a survey)

ðŸ’¡ I have marked it as maybe relevant only because we may want to mention the two approaches (embedding secrets and biometrics) in our paper.
