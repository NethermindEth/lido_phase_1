# Digital Identities and Verifiable Credentials

Abstract: In this catchword, we introduce this decentralized, interoperable approach to digital identity management. In particular, we discuss the challenges of todayâ€™s centralized identity management and investigate current developments regarding verifiable credentials and digital wallets. Finally, we offer suggestions about promising areas of research into decentralized digital identities.

I think that the paper does not explain very well the concept of Verifiable credentials, but  I rated as ``very relevant''  because it gives some useful references that we can use for the introduction of the SoK. For example in section 2.2 it gives some examples why Identity Data Stored in Centralized databases can raise security concerns.

We had rated this paper as not relevant because it mainly discusses political incidents when centralized identity is used.
