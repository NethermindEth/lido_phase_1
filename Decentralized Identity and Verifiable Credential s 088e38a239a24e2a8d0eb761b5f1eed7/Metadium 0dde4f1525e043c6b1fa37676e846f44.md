# Metadium

Abstract: The goal of the Metadium project is to create a next-generation identity ecosystem powered by a public ID blockchain platform. In this ecosystem, everyone has the control over their own identity and personal information. In pursuit of this ambitious goal, Metadium envisions an ecosystem that incorporates a three-tier structure composed of a platform, protocol, and a service.  What distinguishes the Metadium blockchain from other platforms such as Bitcoin and Ethereum is the fact that Metadium is an “ID blockchain”. In an ID blockchain, the owner of the personal information can directly create, manage, and control his or her data, and store all records of personal information usage on a blockchain.  Metadium project is an identity project composed of a public blockchain ID platform, a Meta ID protocol, and service application.

- Their system allows one to use his Meta ID as a self-sovereign identity. Individuals can use Metadium and their Meta ID on other platforms and services, making it a gateway to support various other platforms.
- Their solutions contain the internal features of a subject in addition to KYCcompliant identities based on attestation and a reputation system. That differentiates it from other decentralized digital identity projects using blockchain technology.
- Metadium is designed to support off-chain and inter-blockchain identity with oracles.

## Blockchain features

**Scalability:** Metadium blockchain will handle block generation and transaction separately on top of Proof of Authority consensus.

**Expandability:** Both DApps on the Metadium blockchain and other blockchains can be used in the Metadium ecosystem. This also includes ongoing services outside the blockchain. 

## Architecture

Metadium blockchain is constructed on two main pillars, which are 

- The **community pillar**, governed by delegators voted in by the community.
- The **block producer pillar**, governed by the authorities proven to act reasonably and designated to secure the network.

### Participants in Metadium block producer pillar

**Block Producers (Nodes) are limited to publicly accredited or designated authorities by Metadium.** Block producers are incentivized and rewarded for producing blocks and securing the network. 

### Participants in Metadium community pillar

**The User** is the subject of identity.  Any subject possessing any form of identity can be a user of Meta ID.

**Attestation agencies** are providers of legitimacy in a trustless blockchain environment. Users may have their identities certified through attestation agencies, including public notary offices, financial institutions, and other qualified parties. Only eligible parties are allowed to act as attestation agencies on the Metadium blockchain.

**Service providers** are the parties to whom the user identities are in demand. Service providers can provide services through dApps via Meta ID smart contracts, which can be used to identify the Meta ID of the user.

## META economics

Using Meta ID infrastructure, a wide-range of dApps and services will be built on top of the Metadium blockchain protocol. 

For decentralized identity infrastructure, META acts as a medium of exchange for identity attestation and sharing:

- Attestation agencies will be rewarded for providing attestation services once the validated data has been used.
- Service providers will reward attestation agencies and users with META in return for obtaining and using identity data.
- Users will be rewarded for providing their own identity data and can use META to purchase identity related services provided by Metadium and other service providers.
