# Identifying and characterizing Sybils in the Tor network

Abstract: Being a volunteer-run, distributed anonymity network,
Tor is vulnerable to Sybil attacks. Little is known about
real-world Sybils in the Tor network, and we lack practical tools and methods to expose Sybil attacks. In this
work, we develop sybilhunter, a system for detecting
Sybil relays based on their appearance, such as configuration; and behavior, such as uptime sequences. We
used sybilhunterâ€™s diverse analysis techniques to analyze
nine years of archived Tor network data, providing us
with new insights into the operation of real-world attackers. Our findings include diverse Sybils, ranging from
botnets, to academic research, and relays that hijacked
Bitcoin transactions. Our work shows that existing Sybil
defenses do not apply to Tor, it delivers insights into realworld attacks, and provides practical tools to uncover
and characterize Sybils, making the network safer for its
users
