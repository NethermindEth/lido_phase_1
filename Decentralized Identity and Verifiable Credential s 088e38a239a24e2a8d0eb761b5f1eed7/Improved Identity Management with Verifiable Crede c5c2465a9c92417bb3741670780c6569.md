# Improved Identity Management with Verifiable Credentials and FIDO

Abstract: We describe how FIDO and W3C VCs can overcome the problems of existing identity management systems. We describe our conceptual model and architecture, and the protocol we used by extending FIDO’s UAF in order to provide both strong authentication and strong authorization.
We built a pilot implementation for U.K. NHS patients to validate our implementation. Patients were able to use a mobile phone with a fingerprint reader to access restricted NHS sites in order to
make and cancel appointments and order repeat prescription drugs. Our initial user trials with 10 U.K. NHS patients found the system to be easy to use, and fingerprints to be preferable to using usernames and passwords for authentication.

**Overview**:

- The paper discusses the W3C data model for VC and authentication protocols from the Fast Identity Online Alliance (FIDO).
- The contribution of the paper is to extend such protocol so that it also allows for **authentication**

**Assessment**

Marked as “maybe relevant”: 

- The description of W3C’s VC and FIDO could be of interest to us
- It is unclear whether we need authorization protocols. But if we do, we could take a look here.
