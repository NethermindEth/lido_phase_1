# Jolocom

Abstract: Jolocom develops an open source protocol for
decentralized identity management designed
along the principles of Self-Sovereign Identity.

The Jolocom Protocol facilitates the generation and management of
Decentralized Identifiers, Verifiable Credentials, and cryptographic signatures
— the core building blocks of Jolocom identities. Jolocom identities are created entirely locally using hierarchical deterministic keys and are designed to enable management of multiple personas by individual users as well as preservation of pairwise anonymity in context-specific interactions.

The protocol logic encodes a granular, claim-based model of identity that is highly generalized and unrestrictive in scope in order to accommodate
a multiplicity of potential use cases and broad range of subjects of identity (users), including individual persons as well non-person entities
like organizations (e.g. companies, governmental bodies), IoT devices (e.g.
hardware/software agents), and autonomous agents (e.g. DAOs).

The project seems to mostly focus on providing general infrastructure for the creation and management of VC’s, DiD, etc. For this reason, it may not be of interest to us, but further investigation needs to be made to confirm this.

**Further investigation**

The project seems to be an SDK (Software Development Kit) for managing DID and Verifiable Credentials, as specified in W3C. 

The whitepaper reads as a derivative, less-technical, and more smoky version of W3C’s specification docs. It never gets into any technical details (not even code-wise), despite being 50 pages long.

**This project is relevant only for the development side of the project**: their general SDK may be used as a starting point towards implementing Lido’s solution. They also offer assistance with development

Note: Jolocom has a DID and VC wallet as well, but I could not find any documentation (see below).

**Products**

- **Jolocom SDK.** This is a toolkit for managing SSI Agents and the interactions carried out between them. The SDK builds upon implementations of the following specifications:
    - [W3C Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/): To provide identifiers for Agents managed by the SDK.
    - [W3C Verifiable Credentials (VCs)](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/): To allow for verifiable attestations to be exchanged and utilised by Agents.
- **Assistance in developing an SSI platform.** They can take care of development or help with it.
- **Formation on the topic of SSI**: They offer formation (courses, talks, etc.) on the topic of SSI.
- **Web3 wallet**: They have a wallet that stores Verifiable Credentials.
    
    I could not find any documentation and the website gives only 3-4 sentences of vague information. I installed the wallet on my phone and it allows to scan QR codes, which I assume are supposed to start a protocol for adding Verifiable Credentials to the wallet (linking such VC’s to a DID created by the wallet).
    

I got a negative impression by the smokiness of Jolocom overall. As an example, this is the first thing one sees when looking for information about their wallet:
