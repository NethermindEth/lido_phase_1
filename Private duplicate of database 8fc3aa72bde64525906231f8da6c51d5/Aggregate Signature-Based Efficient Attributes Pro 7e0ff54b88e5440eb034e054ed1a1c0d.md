# Aggregate Signature-Based Efficient Attributes Proof with Pairing-Based Anonymous Credential

Abstract: We present a novel pairing-based anonymous credential in the random oracle model. To solve the linear complexity of attributes proof, it is to certify each single attribute in an individual credential, and prove any combination of attributes by aggregating the corresponding credentials into a single one. The BLS signature and BGLS aggregate signature schemes are extended to construct anonymous credentials. Through performance analysis of attributes proof of AND relation, our anonymous credential can obtain the constant complexity respect to the number of exponentiations and parings, at the meanwhile, the signature and public parameters are short.

## Summary/**Assessment**

by ****Nan Guo, Jianju Cheng, Bin Zhang, Kangbin Yim. This paper slightly modifies BLS and BGLS and considers credentials as signatures on a message. This paper is quite hard to read, and it is not very clear what is going on. It has been published in 2013 and has 2 citations. For these reasons we mark it as not relevant.
