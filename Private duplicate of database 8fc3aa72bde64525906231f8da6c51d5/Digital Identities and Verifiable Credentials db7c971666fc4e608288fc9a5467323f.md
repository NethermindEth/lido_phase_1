# Digital Identities and Verifiable Credentials

Abstract: Public institutions and companies typically employ physical credentials (such as passports, social security cards, and employee badges) to identify individuals. Individuals can choose where to store their physical credentials, and sometimes, they can decide to whom their credentials are disclosed. These familiar privileges inspired a new type of digital credential called a verifiable credential (VC). Similar to physical credentials, individuals can store their verifiable credentials in a so-called digital wallet on their mobile phone, on another edge device, or in the cloud, and they can use verifiable credentials for identification, authentication, and authorization (Sporny et al. 2019).

## Summary/Assessment

The paper references the status quo in terms of DI and VC, and how big companies hoarding data provoked a resurgence of the idea of sovereign identity. Since there is very little technical content in the paper, this is unrelated to our problem. We mark it as not relevant.
