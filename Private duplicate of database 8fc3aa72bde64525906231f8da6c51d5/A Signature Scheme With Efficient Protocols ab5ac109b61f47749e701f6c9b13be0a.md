Discusses, among others, that anonymous credentials can be constructed from signature and committment schemes, and some extra protocols. It is a derivative of Lysyanskayaâ€™s thesis, see [****Signature schemes and applications to cryptographic protocol design****](Signature%20schemes%20and%20applications%20to%20cryptographi%20e29ee2c0749c4b7bbc3d3d1788c80ad0.md)
