# The Sybil Attacks and Defenses: A Survey

Abstract: In this paper we take a close look at the Sybil attack and advances in defending against it, with particular emphasis on recent work. We identify three major veins in the research literature that describe ways to defend against the attack: using trusted certification, using resource testing, and using social networks. The first vein in the literature considers defending against the attack using trusted certification, which is done by either centralized certification or distributed certification using cryptographic primitives that can replace the centralized certification entity. The second vein in the literature considers defending against the attack by testing resources, which can
be in the form of IP testing, network coordinates, or recurring cost (e.g., by requiring clients to solve puzzles). The third and last vein in the literature is by mitigating the attack, combining social
networks used as bootstrap security and tools from random walk theory, which was shown to be effective in defending against the attack under certain assumptions. Our survey and analyses of the different schemes in the three veins in the literature show several shortcomings, which form several interesting directions and research questions worthy of investigation.
