# Verifiable Credentials in the Token Economy

Abstract: This chapter envisions how verifiable credentials could work in the token economy. Many standards-making bodies, open source working groups, organizations, and individuals are working on self-sovereign identity (SSI) and decentralized verifiable credentials. Commonly suggested principles include identity binding, privacy and security, user control, availability to all, interoperability across platforms, user consent, data minimization, and transparency about data creation, collection, storage, and use. Solutions will likely make use of consensus-driven, international standards in distributed technologies like smart wallets, blockchains, utility tokens, and decentralized identifiers (DIDs). To achieve this vision, the roles of issuers, holders, and verifiers—known as the “trust triangle”—must be incentivized to adopt the solution. We provide examples of two early solutions for verifiable credentials: SmartResume and digital health passes (DHPs). iDatafy’s SmartResume is a job market platform that creates digital resumes based on verifiable credentials and secures these credentials on a blockchain. Digital health passes (DHPs) prove our health to verifiers so we can return to travel, work, school, and play. We assess the degree to which these solutions subscribe to the suggested principles of verifiable credentials and describe how participants are incentivized to join the ecosystem. We found that these first-generation solutions meet some, but not yet all, of the suggested principles for fully decentralized verifiable credentials. The early solutions are “minimal viable products” that will likely improve in the future based on feedback and experimentation. Trusted third parties are still needed for services, and interoperability standards, user-generated identifiers, utility tokens are not yet advanced enough for wide-scale adoptions of SSI and verifiable credentials, but we can more easily see the possibilities.

This chapter mostly talks about the current shared ideas for Verifiable credentials, Self-Soverign Identity and Decentralized Identities. Ideas includes that of W3C Verifiable credentials resource.

After going through this ideas it shows two examples of implementations(A job market place and a Health pass).

The chapter remark some key points

1. First-generation solutions cannot subscribe to all of the principles envisioned for fully decentralized self-sovereign identity and verifiable credentials.
    1. trusted third parties still are needed to manage the network
    2. verifiable credentials are not yet accessible to all; they are not interoperable or portable across platforms
    3. “This idea of a decentralized world offers so many benefits. But for now, I guarantee you if SmartResume was a completely autonomous decentralized system and you had a problem with one of your credentials, there would be no one to help.”
2. Minimal viable products are not designed to be perfect.
    1. We should expect glitches, it is how these systems will improve.
3. The technology was the easier part, while building the ecosystem was the harder part.
    1. All members of the trust triangle(Issuer, Holder and Verifier) must be incentivized to join the solution.
    2. Interoperability standards, user-generated identifiers, and utility tokens are not yet advanced enough for wide-scale adoption.
    3. Utility tokens, in particular, could provide a way to finance completely decentralized solutions.
    

Mark as non relevant since the paper mostly makes a recapitulation of ideas and provides examples
