# Self-Sovereign Identity Solutions: The Necessity of Blockchain Technology.

Abstract: With the advancement of technology and subsequently the age of digital information, online trustworthy identification has become increasingly more important. With respect to the various data breaches and privacy regulations, the current identity solutions are not fully optimized. In this paper, we will
take a look at several Self-Sovereign Identity solutions which are already available. Some of them are built upon blockchain technology as this already provides decentralized persistent data and consensus. We will explore the emerging landscape of SelfSovereign Identity solutions and dissect their implementations under multiple aspect criteria to determine the necessity of
blockchain technology in this field. We conclude that blockchain technology is not explicitly required for a Self-Sovereign Identity solution but it is a good foundation to build up on, due to various technical advantages that the blockchain has to offer.

This paper contributes to the literature by comparing currently available blockchain-based and other state-of-the-art solutions.

The paper is good for collecting protocols implementing a Self-Sovereign Identity, but not much else. Marked as non-relevant
