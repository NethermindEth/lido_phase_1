# Sovrin : digital identities in the blockchain era

Abstract: In this paper we describe a practical digital identity project of a global scale, which solves a number of privacy and scalability problems using the concepts of anonymous credentials and permissioned blockchains. Even though both ideas have been known and developed for a number of years, our system appears to be the first amalgamation. The prototype has been developed, tested, and published as open source.

The paper’s main focus is dealing with a credential system provided by a centralized Issuer, especially how to handle the revocation list in a privacy preserving manner.  I don’t think this is applicable to our case where the problem is figuring out which credentials to revoke in a decentralized manner rather than distributing revocation lists prepared by a central Issuer.

In any case the paper is rather light on specifics.
