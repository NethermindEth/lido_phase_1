From their FAQ:

> Moralis is a leading web3 development platform that offers everything a user needs to create, launch and grow great decentralized applications (dapps) in one place. It is the quickest method to create and deploy dapps on Ethereum, BNB, Polygon, Avalanche, Fantom, and more.

Moralis provides developers with APIs that facilitate querying different blockchains in order to build applications. The relation between Web2 and Web3 alluded to above comes from their [Authentication API](https://moralis.io/authentication/), which allows to “Unify Web3 Wallets and Web2 Accounts in Your Application.”

This API is meant to feed on-chain data to off-chain applications, which is the opposite direction of what we are interested in. Therefore, this product is not relevant to us.
