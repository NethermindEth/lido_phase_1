# Privacy-Preserving PayString Service

Abstract: PayString is an initiative to make payment identifiers global and human-readable, facilitating the exchange of payment information. However, the reference implementation lacks privacy and security features, making it possible for anyone to access the payment information as long as the PayString identifier is known. We propose an innovative solution, named PayStringSecure, for this issue by integrating a privacy layer based on Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI), Decentralized Identifier (DID) and Verifiable Credential (VC) to the PayString protocol. A working prototype has been developed to enrich the protocol with the new features.

This paper proposes the use of a layer to implement DID, VC ans SSI in a payment service.

It assumes the use of Hyperledger Indy but does not provide anything useful. Mark as not relevant since we are better off looking at Hyperledger Indy.
