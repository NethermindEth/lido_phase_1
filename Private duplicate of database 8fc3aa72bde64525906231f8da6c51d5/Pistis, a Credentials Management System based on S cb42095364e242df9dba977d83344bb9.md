# Pistis, a Credentials Management System based on Self-Sovereign Identity

Abstract: This thesis work builds on top of those standards and proposes a new Self Sovereign Identity based credentials management systems running on the Ethereum blockchain: "Pistis". It aims at being a truly usable, scalable, decentralized and interoperable system. "Pists DID Method" has been officially reviewed and accepted by the W3C group responsible for those new standards.

This thesis proposes a credential management system (Pistis) on top of the concepts of VC and DID of W3C. The Pistis system is designed to run on Ethereum. It may be relevant to our aim of managing operators’ identities. It provides quite a good literature search. It gave us useful references on both the theoretical and applied sides.   

Note on November 3, 2022 :

I changed the score of the paper to “maybe relevant” because it just discusses a credential management system based on the SSI approach. It does not discuss Sybil-resistance and decentralized credential issuance which may be seen as the main focus of our project.
