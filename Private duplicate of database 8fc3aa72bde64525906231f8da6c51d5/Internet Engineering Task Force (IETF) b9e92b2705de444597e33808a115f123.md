# Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)

Abstract: (Association)
Labels: Standardization efforts
Link to the paper: https://www.ietf.org/
Score: no idea
Score Phase 1: Maybe relevant
Year: NA

I couldn’t find any documentation on the IETF website. All the statements including VC and DID are linked to the recommendations of W3C. 

I don't think this is relevant. But waiting for a reviewer to double-check. So I made its score “Maybe relevant”.
