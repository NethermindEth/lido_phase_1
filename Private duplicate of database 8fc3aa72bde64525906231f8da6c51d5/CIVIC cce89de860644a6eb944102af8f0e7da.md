# CIVIC

Abstract: Civic Pass is an on-chain solution that enables decentralized Apps (dApps) to restrict access to their offerings by vetting users in a way that protects user's privacy while giving dApp creators and users the freedom to use a dApp, knowing that all other participants have passed identity verification or liveness criteria.
dApp developers, liquidity providers and institutional participants can manage risk and create trust in the crypto ecosystem with Civic’s tools. As a dApp developer you can select the checks you want for your platform:
-Real person liveness check (ie. no bots)
-Global identity verification
-Watchlist screening and ongoing monitoring (OFAC, sanctions lists, Politically Exposed Person (PEP) checks etc.)
-IP-based location checks including VPN detection
-Email and phone verification

## Abstract

Civic Pass is an on-chain solution that enables decentralized Apps (dApps) to restrict access to their offerings by vetting users in a way that protects user's privacy while giving dApp creators and users the freedom to use a dApp, knowing that all other participants have passed identity verification or liveness criteria.

dApp developers, liquidity providers and institutional participants can manage risk and create trust in the crypto ecosystem with Civic’s tools. As a dApp developer you can select the checks you want for your platform:

- Real person liveness check (ie. no bots)
- Global identity verification
- Watchlist screening and ongoing monitoring (OFAC, sanctions lists, Politically Exposed Person (PEP) checks etc.)
- IP-based location checks including VPN detection
- Email and phone verification

As Civic Pass is an **on-chain solution**, your dApp users can interact your dApp through both a User Interface or an API, safe in the knowledge that all the other dApp users have been vetted.

## Assessment

The solution is a simple set of certificates added to a user’s wallet which dApps can request. dApps can then reject users that do not have a specific type of pass. The identity management system seems to integrate many of the elements which we already talked about:

The information available does not provide further clarifications as to how they might ensure the authenticity of the different methods presented. They seem to overlook Sybil-related problems, as well as the trustworthiness of the relevant information sources.

## Score

They are thinking of using some interesting biometric as well as governmental information. However, we think the solution is simplistic, and we worry that the team is not dealing with many subtleties. It is not clear how performant some of their tools are, like face recognition for example. It is interesting how they are using almost exclusively Web2/real world data. We will leave it as maybe relevant for now, but we would be inclined to mark it as not relevant.
