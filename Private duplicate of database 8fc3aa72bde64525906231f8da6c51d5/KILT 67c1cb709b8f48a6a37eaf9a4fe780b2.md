# KILT

Abstract: KILT is a protocol for self-sovereign data and interoperability built on top of the permissionless KILT blockchain. The core component of KILT is a digital identity protocol for 1. generating and managing decentralized identifiers (DIDs)
, and 2. issuing and presenting digital verifiable credentials (VCs)
. In contrast to other centralized alternatives, KILT features self-sovereign data as well as revocable credentials anchored to the KILT blockchain.

KILT is a protocol for self-sovereign data and interoperability built on top of the permissionless KILT blockchain. The core component of KILT is a digital identity protocol for 
1. generating and managing **decentralized identifiers (DIDs)**
2. issuing and presenting digital **verifiable credentials (VCs).**
In contrast to other centralized alternatives, KILT features self-sovereign data as well as revocable credentials anchored to the KILT blockchain.

**KILT is the first parachain to relocate from Kusama to Polkadot.**  

**KILT is a permissionless system, anyone (or anything) could create an identity or define qualities or characteristics of such entity and therefore become an entity in the KILT network.** In KILT, the identity is created as public-private key pair and then linked to a Decentralised Identifier (DID). This DID is under full control of the entity which created it.

**KILT Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)**

**Light DIDs:** The simplest type of KILT DID is called a **light DID**, because it can be generated and used offline without any internet connection.

**Full DIDs:** The creation of a full DID requires interaction with the KILT blockchain. Therefore, the DID creation operation must be submitted by a KILT address with enough funds to pay the transaction fees and the required deposit.

**Claim Types (CTYPEs)**

CTypes are data types specific to KILT that define the structure of a claim (i.e., its data model). CTypes are based on JSON Schema, a standard used to annotate and validate JSON documents. The schema defines which properties exist and what their type should be, e.g., a string, a number, an object, etc.

The creation of CTYPEs is permissionless. Anyone can create CTYPEs and reference them on the KILT Blockchain.

After creating a CType, its full content is included only in the blockchain block history, while its hash is anchored to the blockchain state.

**Claimer(Holder)**

The Claimer is an entity (an individual, organization, or object) that claims something (a property) about itself using its decentralized identifier and stores this Claim in its client wallet software. In KILT, the Claimer always signs the claim, which proves that the creator of the claim is the same entity as the owner of the claim (i.e. a Claimer is always the origin of the Claim).
A Claim is always based on a Claim Type definition **(CTYPE)**, which is a well-defined data structure expressing a specific set of properties and rules for a certain type of claim.

Claimer controls
 ● who to present the Credential to
 ● which Credential is presented and
 ● which parts of the content of the Credential she makes visible to the Verifier.

**Attester(Issuer)**
KILT Protocol offers a mechanism for Claimers to pay for the work of Attesters by transferring KILT tokens to an Attester.
In this process Attesters perform actual work as they must check the validity of Claimer’s assertions.
****Attesters create Credentials by cryptographically signing the attestations and sending them back to the Claimers. **Then Attesters send the hash of credentials to the blockchain.**
Any Attester will only be prepared to check and confirm a limited range of properties. According to these capabilities the Attester chooses one or more Claim Types (CTYPEs) offering to attest them for interested Claimers.
The Claimers can select the Attester who best fits their needs (price, speed of attestation, supported Credential types, number and importance of Verifiers trusting their Credentials). This creates business opportunities for Attesters.
Additionally, Attesters can amplify their trust by cooperating with other attesters or can delegate trust to other entities.

**Verifier**
The Verifier creates the demand for attested Credentials as he offers a service to Claimers. As the Claimers are not inherently trusted by the Verifiers, the Verifiers rely on the Attesters and the trust they provide.
**Verifiers decide which Attesters they trust.** Claimers will select Attesters who are trusted by Verifiers and are relevant to the Claimer’s use case.
Any Verifier who receives the resulting Credential from a Claimer can hash the Credential and check if the identical hash is also present on the blockchain in order to verify that action.

Verifiers identify Claimers through a Cryptographic Challenge. KILT uses Merkle Trees to ensure that Credentials can be validated against hashes retrieved from the KILT Blockchain, even if the Claimer only reveals parts of the information inside the Credential. 

**Revocable Attestations**
Putting the Claimer in control of her Credentials imposes a new problem: as the Attester is no longer involved in the Verification process, he cannot revoke the validity of Credentials. The KILT Blockchain solves this problem by writing a hash of the Attestation onto the blockchain. This way Attestations can be securely stored and time can be stamped on the KILT blockchain, which then fulfils a notary function and enables credential revocations.

In case of an on-chain Attestation four pieces of information are written onto the blockchain:

- Public key of the Attester
- Hash of the Claim that is being attested
- Signature of the Attester
- Placeholder field to mark if the Attestation is revoked later.

Any Verifier who receives the resulting Credential from a Claimer can hash the Credential and check if the identical hash is also present on the blockchain in order to verify that action.
The Attester has the right to revoke the hash on the blockchain, thus marking it as invalid. Verifiers checking for the hash on the blockchain will find out about the revocation.

This process can also be applied to Legitimations and Delegations of trust (will be described later).

The content of the Claim is not revealed and the Claim itself is not made available on the blockchain. The public key of the Attester is stored on the chain. This is a wanted property which enables Verifiers to determine if the Attester of a Claim is trusted. 

**Payment Transactions**
The KILT blockchain will contain its own cryptocurrency: the KILT Coin. This Coin is used to incentivise the security and continuous operation of the KILT network. Moreover, the KILT Coin is used to pay for the registration of CTYPEs, writing Attestations, and issuing revocations on the blockchain. The KILT Coin is used for paying the Attester for the Attestation service.

# Building Top-Down Structures in KILT

As KILT is a **permissionless network,** anyone can become an Attester and provide attestations for any Claim. Removing the barrier to being part of the system and to embody any role is fundamental to the design of the KILT network. **This implies that Claimers and Verifiers know which Attester to trust and which not to trust.** In other words, the Verifiers decide to accept a Claim based on their trust in the Attester. 
The Verifiers’ trust in an Attester can be achieved in different ways: The Verifier might directly trust the Attester. Alternatively, the Attester inherits trust through legitimation or delegation from another Attester and the Verifiers’ trust in the Attester is derived from a specific trust structure, modelling real-world trust relationships.
Top-down trust implies that there are entities which are trusted by other entities because of their status, their reputation, or just by definition.

A legitimation is a Credential by a trusted source that grants specific permissions (“capabilities”) to another entity.
The simplest and most general example: Attester A1 legitimises A2 by attesting its arbitrary claim. Attester A2 then uses this attested claim (legitimation) to serve Claimer C. 

![Source:[KILT-White-Paper-v2020-Jan-15.pdf](https://www.kilt.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/KILT-White-Paper-v2020-Jan-15.pdf)](KILT%2067c1cb709b8f48a6a37eaf9a4fe780b2/kilt7.png)

When requesting an attestation, it is the Claimer’s responsibility to check if the legitimation of the Attester is sound. It also is the Verifier’s responsibility to check if the legitimation chain is complete (i.e. no link was revoked) when verifying a credential backed by a legitimation chain.
The Claimer and the Verifier must be able to access all information that is required to make sure that the legitimation chain is valid. 

# **Hierarchy of Trust**

A Hierarchy of Trust is a hierarchical top-down trust structure where the KILT Validator Nodes check the complete authorization or delegation chain for attesting a specific CTYPE.

Adopting this concept for KILT means that a trusted root can delegate trust to other entities and build a Hierarchy of Trust around a specific use case (i.e. a CTYPE). Starting from the root, entities can delegate the right to issue attestations to Claimers for a certain CTYPE.

![Source:[KILT-White-Paper-v2020-Jan-15.pdf](https://www.kilt.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/KILT-White-Paper-v2020-Jan-15.pdf)](KILT%2067c1cb709b8f48a6a37eaf9a4fe780b2/kilt8.png)

Source:[KILT-White-Paper-v2020-Jan-15.pdf](https://www.kilt.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/KILT-White-Paper-v2020-Jan-15.pdf)

Attesters inherit the trust *directly* or *indirectly* from a trusted source or root.

**These structures are always stored and updated on the KILT blockchain (using delegation transactions).** The resulting delegation chains are always available for the Validator Nodes since they are stored on-chain. This means that the **Validator Nodes write an attestation backed by delegation to the chain only if the delegation chain is valid at the time of attestation.** This way the Verifier can be sure that the delegation chain was valid if the attestation is valid.

As it can happen that an Employee loses the right to attest the specific CTYPE of the Hierarchy (e.g. leaves a company), this also needs to be reflected in the path of authorization. In case the Department revokes the right of Employee 1 to attest the University Degree CTYPE, **it issues a revocation of authorization of Employee 1.**
Should Employee 1 later try to issue an attestation for this CTYPE and try to forge the path of authorization, the Validators will not write the attestation on the blockchain.
Also, the Claimer could present a forged off-chain attestation, but when the Verifier checks the authorization chain on the KILT blockchain, he will not find it and therefore not trust the Credential.
Past attestations that happened before the revocation of authorization remain valid as the time of the revocation is later than the time of the attestation. 

# **dApps**

- **Sporran** - a wallet for KILT Coins and credentials
- **Stakeboard** - a staking platform for backing KILT collators with KILT Coins
- **SocialKYC** - an identity verification service for social media credentials
- **DIDsign** - a decentralized way to sign any digital file directly in your browser
- **web3name** - a unique name for your digital identity that can be used across ecosystems and linked with addresses and credentials.

# web3name

There is a one-to-one relationship between DIDs and web3names. This means that a KILT DID can be linked to only one web3name, and a web3name can be claimed only by one DID.

With web3name, you can now replace a DID string like this:

*did:kilt:4s8kEBWV9nwU5znxmfR7DVA31DdBoqYGr49SAiAPzzigwJDm*

with this:

*w3n:ingo*

# Sporran

Sporan is the KILT wallet. 

Unlike crypto wallets, it can also create DIDs and stores those DIDs on the KILT Blockchain. It can request, store, maintain, sign and share credentials.

Creating DIDs with the Sporran

- User installs Sporran extensions and creates a KILT account
- A local DID can be used for cryptographic challenges
- This DID can be anchored on the KILT blockchain, making it accessible from other blockchains.

The first step is to set up Sporran, a browser extension for Firefox and Chrome that acts as a wallet for KILT logins and KILT coins. Once done, you will receive your first DID. Your digital identity is complemented with various credentials such as email, Twitter account, passport, certificate, etc.

# S**ocialKYC**

KYC or “Know Your Customer” is standard practice while opening an account with a bank, proving that you own your government-issued credentials like a passport. 
“SocialKYC” verifies a user’s internet identity by proving control of their social accounts, email address or phone number. Unlike Web 2.0 sign-in processes, SocialKYC forgets about the user and the credential as soon as the credential is issued. Personal data is not stored, siloed or shared.
SocialKYC and Sporran allow users to manage and store their personal credentials and control the items of personal information they share with online services.

SocialKYC’s approach to sensitive personal data is completely different from Web 2.0 systems. It forgets the user’s credentials if they are provided by the system.

- First, SocialKYC sends users a simple task to verify their control over a given account (verify your email address; tweet this to prove this is your account). Friend).
- After a successful check, SocialKYC issues credentials to the user. Users can save credentials in their Sporran wallet. Credentials indicate ownership of a specific account.
- This personal data is not stored or passed on by SocialKYC. It remains in the user’s sporran wallet under their [complete control.](https://news.coincu.com/)
- Through the Sporran wallet, users can submit their credentials to any online service that accepts them.

**Online services that can be submitted to socialKYC:**

Email Adress

Phone Number

GitHub

Twitter

Discord

Tiktok

Instagram

Twitch

Telegram

Twitter case:

- Server receives the username from the user.
- The server prepares a Request for attestation object for the user to sign and sends it to the user. This object contains the username but is not stored anywhere.
- Server receives the signed Request for attestation object from the user and temporarily stores it until the user confirmation, but no longer than 1 hour after the last user activity. The object contains the username and the DID. SocialKYC asks the user to Tweet a predefined text. The text contains a confirmation code: a random number that references the user data but does not contain it. The server stores the username and starts periodically checking public tweets of this username looking for the confirmation code.
- If the user is inactive for one hour, all their stored data, the username, and the confirmation code are deleted.
- If the user tweets the predefined text containing the confirmation code, then server detects this and stops checking the tweets of this username. The server signs the stored Request for attestation object. Only the signature is then stored on the public KILT blockchain, but the signature itself does not contain any of the personal information, and this information is not recoverable from the signature. **After that all the information stored about this user is immediately deleted from the server.**
