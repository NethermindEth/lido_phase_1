# Distributed-Ledger-based Authentication with Decentralized Identifiers and Verifiable Credentials

Abstract: Authentication with username and password is becoming an inconvenient process for the user. End users typically have little control over their personal privacy, and data breaches effecting millions of users have already happened several times. We have implemented a proof of concept decentralized OpenID Connect Provider by marrying it with Self-Sovereign Identity, which gives users the freedom to choose from a very large pool of identity providers instead of just a select few corporations, thus enabling the democratization of the highly centralized digital identity landscape. Furthermore, we propose a verifiable credential powered decentralized Public Key Infrastructure using distributed ledger technologies, which creates a straightforward and verifiable way for retrieving digital certificates.

**Overview**

Contributions of the paper:

- Reviewing Self Sovereign Identity (SSI) authentication methods
- Designing a SSI approach using the OpenID Connect standard (AFAIU, this is a standard enabling single signing in a way similar to what Google and Facebook do).

**Assessment**

All methods discussed seem to rely on permissioned entities. 

This makes the paper not relevant to us.
